# Scanning a Target Network
Network Scanning refers to a set of procedures performed to identify hosts, ports, and services running in a network.

The purpose of network scanning is as follows:

* Recognize available UDP and TCP network services running on the targeted hosts.
* Recognize filtering systems between the user and the targeted hosts.
* Determine the operating systems (OSs) in use by assessing IP responses.
* Evaluate the target host's TCP sequence number predictability to determine sequence prediction attack and TCP spoofing.
