# Cloud computing

- Cloud computing = On-demand access to IT capabilities
- Before cloud computing
  - Everything was stored and processed locally (on-premises)
  - Centralized, secluded and segmented
- Now third party (cloud provider) stores the data.

## NIST definition of cloud computing

### Essential characteristics

- **On-demand self-service**
  - Consumers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities
    - E.g. computing power, storage, network
  - Does not require human interaction
- **Broad network access**
  - Capabilities are available and accessible over the network.
  - Via wide variety of platforms e.g. laptops, mobile phones and PDAs
- **Resource pooling**
  - Uses multi-tenant model to provide resources pooled to serve multiple consumers
    - The instances (tenants) are logically isolated, but physically integrated.
    - One or multiple instances of one or multiple applications operate in a shared environment.
  - Assigns different physical and virtual resources dynamically
  - Location is abstracted to e.g. country, state or data-center
    - Exact location is unknown to user
- **Rapid elasticity**
  - Feeling of "infinite" and instant scalability
  - Usually automatically
- **Measured service**
  - Metering capability in an abstracting way e.g. storage, processing, bandwidth, active user accounts.
  - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported

## Cloud computing service models

### Infrastructure as a services (IaaS)

- Capability for consumers to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources
- Aims to give most control over the provided hardware that runs applications
  - E.g. operating systems, storage, and networking components
- E.g. virtual machines (EC2 in Amazon), virtual networks.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Provides capability for consumers to deploy onto managed cloud infrastructure
- Allows consumer to use programming languages, SDKs, services, and tools supported by the provider
- Consumer does not control or manage underlying cloud infrastructure
  - But can control deployed applications and configurations for the hosting environment
- Provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications
  - Can add features such authentication.
- Aims to help creating an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- E.g. development tools, config management, and deployment platforms

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
- User does not control underlying cloud architecture
  - E.g. network, servers, OS, storage etc.
  - Can only control limited user-specific application configurations.

### IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

![SaaS vs IaaS vs PaaS](img/saas-vs-iaas-vs-paas.png)

### Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS)

- Managed authentication services
- Services include e.g. â€¢Â [Single-Sign-On (SSO)](./../01-introduction/identity-access-management-(iam).md#single-sign-on-sso) â€¢ [Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA)](./../01-introduction/identity-access-management-(iam).md#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) â€¢ Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) â€¢Â Access management â€¢ Intelligence collection

### Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS)

- Integrates security services into corporate infrastructure
- Services include e.g. â€¢ penetration testing â€¢Â authentication â€¢Â intrusion detection â€¢ anti-malware â€¢ security and incident management.
- E.g. [McAfee Cloud Security](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/cloud-security.html)

### Container-as-a-Service (CaaS)

- Container and cluster services
- Services include e.g. â€¢ virtualized container engines â€¢ easier container and cluster management
- Inherits features of [IaaS](#infrastructure-as-a-services-iaas) and [PaaS](#platform-as-a-service-paas)
- See also [container security](./container-security.md)

### Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

- Provides a platform allowing to develop, run, and manage functionalities without any infrastructure effort.
- E.g. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)

## Separation of duties

- Cloud computing is the ultimate in separation of duties
- E.g.
  - The data owner is the entity accountable for the data itself
  - Data custodian is the entity responsible for access to the data
  - When a single individual becomes both the data owner and the data custodian, security issues can arise.
- Also a countermeasure for [insider attacks](./../01-introduction/security-threats-and-attacks.md#insider-attack-countermeasures) and [social engineering attacks](./../10-social-engineering/social-engineering-types.md#social-engineering-countermeasures).

### Shared responsibility

- **On-premises**: you manage everything.
- **IaaS**: provider manages virtualization, servers, storage and networking
- **PaaS**: provider additionally manages OS, middleware and runtime
- **SaaS**: provider manages everything

### Cloud Deployment Models

#### Private cloud

- Provisioned for exclusive use of single organization
- May be owned/managed/operated by the organization, third party or combination
- May be on or off premises

#### Public cloud

- No local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date, everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware.
- Services are rendered over a network
- Provisioned for open use by the general public
- May be owned/managed/operated by a business, academic, government or combination.
- Exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

#### Community Cloud

- Shared infrastructure between several organizations with shared concerns (e.g. compliance)
- Not open to public
- May be owned/managed/operated by the organization, third party or combination
- May be on or off premises

#### Hybrid cloud

- Composition of two or more cloud (private, community or public)
- Infrastructures remain unique entities
  - but are bound by a technology allowing data and application portability.

#### Multi cloud

- Multi-cloud is a environment where an organization leverages two or more cloud computing platforms to perform various tasks
- Increases capabilities with combined offering
- Limits data loss and downtime to a greater extent.
- Management products include â€¢ [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc) â€¢ [Google Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) â€¢ [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/)

## Pros and cons of cloud computing

### Advantages of cloud computing

- **Economical**: Less infrastructure cost, less cost of ownership, fewer capital expenses
- **Operational**: cost efficient, elastic, quick provisioning, automatic updates, backup and recovery...
- **Staffing**: Less staff is required, less personal training
- **Security**: Patch application and updates, less cost on security configurations, better disaster recovery, audit and monitoring on providers side, better management of security systems.
- **Innovation**: Quick access to innovation

### Disadvantages of cloud computing

- Organizations have limited control and flexibility
- Prone to outages and other technical issues
- Security, privacy, and compliance issues
- Contracts and lock-ins
- Depends on network connections
- Can be hard to migrate from one to another

## Cloud regulations

- **FedRAMP**: US regulatory effort regarding cloud computing
- **PCI DSS**: Deals with debit and credit cards, but also has a cloud SIG

## NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture

- High-level conceptual reference architecture

### Cloud actors

- **Cloud Consumer**
  - User of the cloud products and services
- **Cloud Provider**
  - Delivers cloud computing based products and services
- **Cloud Auditor**
  - Can conduct independent assessment of cloud services
- **Cloud Broker**
  - Manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services
  - Negotiates relationships between providers and consumers
  - Service categories
    - **Service Intermediation**: Improves value of a cloud service/function
    - **Service Aggregation**: Combining multiple services to a new one
    - **Service Arbitrage**: Like aggregation but services can be chosen from different vendors.
- **Cloud Carrier**
  - Provides connectivity and transport of cloud services from providers to consumers.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- Span across the cloud and are offered by service providers
- Service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client
