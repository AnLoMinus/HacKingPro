# IoT overview

## IoT basics

- Internet of things
- Extends Internet connectivity beyond standard devices to everyday objects
- Usually uses IPv6 due to the limited number of IPv4 addresses
- Operating systems: Linux or Windows (10) IoT

## Top-level components

- **Device**
  - Includes hardware and software that directly interact with the world.
  - They connect to a network to communicate with each other, or to centralized applications
- **Gateway**
  - Enables services to reach cloud services.
  - Infrastructure component providing security and protocol translations
  - Also used as a service that process data on behalf of group or cluster devices.
  - Often a device e.g. smart home hub.
  - Usually from the same vendor
- **Cloud**
  - See [cloud computing](./../16-cloud-computing/cloud-computing.md)
- **Sensors**
  - Detects, measures or indicates any specific physical quantity
  - E.g. light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or similar entities
  - Converts them into any other form which is mostly, electrical pulses.

## IoT communication models

### Device-To-Device (D2D)

- Direct communication between devices
- Uses a medium such as Bluetooth Low Energy etc.
- Common in home automation systems e.g. light bulbs or wearables e.g. smart watch and heart monitor.
- Simpler security
- E.g. **Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)**
  - Uses Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET)
    - Based on MANET i.e. decentralized wireless network (without routers)

### Device-To-Cloud (D2C)

- IoT device directly communicating with the cloud server
- Often uses ethernet or WiFi
- Lets the user (and an application) to obtain remote access to a device
- E.g. smart card for dogs, remote monitoring
- Two credentials:
  - the network access credentials (such as the mobile device's SIM card)
  - credentials for cloud access
- E.g. [Nest Learning Thermostat](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen)

### Device-To-Gateway (DTG)

- IoT devices basically connect to an intermediary device to access a cloud service
- Often includes an application software operating on a local gateway device (like a smartphone or a "hub")
- Gateway provides security, protocol translation and usually does aggregation
- E.g. [Samsung SmartThing](https://www.smartthings.com/) ecosystem

### Back-end data-sharing

- Extends device-to-cloud model
- Access are granted to the uploaded data to third-parties
- E.g. [Map My Fitness](https://www.mapmyfitness.com/app) that compiles data from other applications

## Layered architecture

- IoT architecture can be categorized into different layers.
- There's no consistency regarding naming of layer.
  - Different methodologies are used but the concepts they represent are very similar.
- üìù It usually consists of 5 layers:
  1. [Edge technology layer](#edge-technology-layer) the "IoT objects collecting data"
  2. [Access gateway layer](#access-gateway-layer) the "data transporter"
  3. [Internet layer](#internet-layer) the "endpoint connector"
  4. [Middleware layer](#middleware-layer) the "data analyzer and processor"
  5. [Application layer](#application-layer) the "user interface"
- Some sources also name sixth layer:
  6. [Business layer](#business-layer) the "core logic"
- Each layer is utilized by layer below without knowledge of other layers

### Five-layers of IoT architecture

#### Edge technology layer

- Also known as **perception layer** or **hardware layer**
- Physical objects (hardware components)
  - Covers IoT capable devices
  - E.g. sensors, actuators, heat sensor, RFID tags, readers, device itself
- Connects devices within network and server
- Gathers environment data
- **Key security components**
  - Encryption and key agreement
  - Sensor data protection
- **Vulnerabilities**
  - Eavesdropping: real time attack to intercept privacy communications.
  - Node Capture: capturing a key node such as gateway to reveal information.
  - Fake Node and Malicious: adding node to input fake data to stop transmitting real information
  - Replay (play back) attack: eavesdrops a communication and reusing it to authenticate.
  - Timing Attack: Extract secrets by observing respond time

#### Access gateway layer

- Also known as **network layer** or **transport layer**
- Handles data transmission i.e. transferring the data through network
- E.g. Wi-Fi, bluetooth
- Enables communication
  - Connects two endpoints e.g. a clients with a device.
  - Includes the initial data handling.
  - Through e.g. message routing, message identification, and subscriptions.
- **Key security components**

  - Denial of Service (DoS) Attack with redundant requests
  - Main-in-The-Middle (MiTM) Attack: to intercept and manipulate data in real-time
  - Storage Attack: Changing data stored in device or cloud
  - Exploit attack: Exploits vulnerabilities in an application, system or hardware

#### Internet layer

- Responsible for end-points connectivity.
- Carries out communication between two endpoints.
  - E.g. device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway and back-end data-sharing.

#### Middleware layer
