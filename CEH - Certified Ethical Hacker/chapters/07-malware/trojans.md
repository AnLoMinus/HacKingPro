# Trojan

- Malware contained inside seemingly harmless programs.
  - activated when such programs are executed.
- Used to gain access and/or cause damage to victims systems.
- Run with same privileges of the victim but can exploit vulnerabilities to gain more privileges.
- Symptoms include
  - change of system settings such as disabling updates, antivirus, task manager
  - more usage of system resources such as network bandwidth and CPU.
- Broad use-cases including
  - Install other malicious code
  - Use victims computer for other attacks including DDoS, or spam e-mails
  - Steal information through keyloggers
  - Running a ransomware
  - Infect victim as proxy-server to do replay attacks

## Trojan communication

- Different trojans use different ports for communication
- üí° Check active connections on different ports to detect presence of trojans.

### Communication paths

#### Overt channels

- Legitimate and transparent paths to send information
- E.g. HTTP and TCP/IP
- Can be exploited to create a [covert channel](#covert-channels)

#### Covert channels

- üìù Sending information by an unknown, unmonitored way
- Outside of the security policy
- Useful to bypass multi-level security solutions in order to leak data out of a protected network
- May use [steganography](./../06-system-hacking/hiding-files.md#steganography)
  - E.g. storage channel
    - Reading tweets from Twitter to get commands from C&C servers
    - Leaves evidence behind
  - E.g. timing channel
    - Small pauses when watching a video sends encoded commands
    - Leaves almost no trace of its existence
    - Requires receiver to be actively listening
  - E.g. use of reserved fields in various packet headers/footers to conceal data
- Utilizes tunneling protocol (allows moving data between different networks)

## Trojan tools

- **Wrapper**
  - An application that can concatenate two executable files and produce an application containing both.
  - Used to embed trojans in legitimate files
  - Can utilize e.g. [`petite.exe`](https://www.un4seen.com/petite/), [IExpress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-ieak/iexpress-command-line-options), [`elitewrap`](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/14593/elitewrap.zip.html)
- **Trojan Construction Kits**
  - Allows you to create a trojan in an easy way
  - E.g. DarkHorse trojan virus maker

## Steps of infecting with a trojan

1. Create a new trojan
2. Create a dropper to install the trojan
3. Create a wrapper to bind trojan into legitimate files
4. Propagate the trojan

## Techniques for evading antivirus

- Do not use a known trojan, it'll be known by antivirus
  - Write your own trojan instead
- üìù Distribute trojan as e.g. `.doc.exe` or `.pdf.exe`
  - Because Windows hides "known extensions" by default so they appear as `.doc` or `.pdf`
- üìù Perform code obfuscation or morphing to confuse anti-viruses
  - E.g. `alert( 'Hello, world!' );` becomes `var _0xc890=["\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"];alert(_0xc890[0])`
- Change the content / checksum or morph it to generate different signatures

## Trojan types

### Remote access trojans (RATs)

- Also known as **remote administration trojans**.
- Malware that includes a back door for administrative control over the target computer
- Includes an user interface to issue commands
- Usually has functionalities like keylogger, camera access, taking screenshots etc.
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ [Saefko](https://cracked.to/Thread-Premium-Cracked-Saefko-Attack-Systems-Most-advanced-RAT-BOT-Ever-Created-V4-FIXED), [njRAT](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/backdoor-njrat/) ‚Ä¢ [turkojan](https://turkojan.blogspot.com/) ‚Ä¢¬†[Biodox](https://ilwebmaster.blogspot.com/2018/04/biodox-v10_16.html)

#### Covert Channel Tunneling Trojan (CCTT)

- A form of RAT
- Enables attackers to gain shell interfaces into and out of a network using authorized channels covertly

### Backdoor trojans

- Trojans that installs backdoors to give uninterrupted access to attackers
- The difference from [RAT](#remote-access-trojans-rats) is that RATs have user interface
- Can usually bypass programs e.g. by injecting connections into browser processes
- Often used to create a botnet or zombie network to execute malicious activities
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ [Qadars](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/qadars-modular-features-that-make-this-a-true-threat) ‚Ä¢ [z3r0 Remvio](https://www.securityweek.com/customizable-remvio-trojan-available-just-58) ‚Ä¢¬†[SubRoot](https://www.fortiguard.com/encyclopedia/virus/7421267)
  - [QAZ Trojan (TROJ_QAZ)](http://www.pchell.com/virus/qaz.shtml)
    - Also known as notepad trojan
    - Replaces notepad.exe on the system in an effort to hide
- See also [backdoor](./malware-overview.md#backdoor)

### Botnet trojans

- ***Bot herders*** are attackers who installs bot programs on victims.
- Infected machines become one of their ***bots*** or ***zombies*** in their ***bot herd***.
- Bots are controlled through Command and Control (C&C) center.
- üìù Bots allow attackers to
  - do DDoS attacks
  - steal data
  - send spam and access the device
- Examples
  - [Conficker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker)
    - Has also worm features to infect other systems in the network.
  - [Mirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware))
    - Infects weak IoT devices.
    - Probes IoT devices in network and brute forces login on Telnet (port 23 and 2323)
    - [Open-sourced](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code)
- See also [Botnet](./../01-introduction/security-threats-and-attacks.md#botnet) and [Botnets | Denial of Service](./../13-web-applications/denial-of-service.md#botnets)

### Rootkit trojans

- Enable access to unauthorized areas in a software
- Root (privilege account in Unix) + kit (software components that implement it)
- Type of backdoors but hard to detect as it often masks its existence
  - E.g. by subverting software that's intended to find it such as hiding its name from service lists, task lists or registry viewers.
- Does not propagate by themselves as opposed to [worms](./malware-overview.md#worm)
- Often used in blended threat
  - **Blended threat** is an exploit that combines elements of multiple types of malware
  - E.g. a malware consisting of  
    - dropper (to install)
    - loader (causes e.g. buffer overflow and load rootkit into memory)
    - rootkit.
- Commonly hidden in the [boot sector](./viruses.md#boot-sector-infectors) of a hard disk to evade antivirus detection.
- E.g.
  - [FinFisher](https://finfisher.com/FinFisher/index.html) - government grade spyware
  - [EquationDrug](https://securelist.com/inside-the-equationdrug-espionage-platform/69203/) - by NSA sponsored [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group)
  - [Boot.Phihar](http://www.malwareremovalguides.info/how-to-remove-boot-pihar-removal-guide/) - affects MBR (master boot record), starting before OS
- See also [Rootkits | Hiding Files](./../06-system-hacking/hiding-files.md#rootkits)

### E-banking Trojans

- Intercepts account information before encryption and sends to attacker.
- Can steal e.g. credit card numbers, billing details
- Can also show false bank account information
- E.g. ZeuS (ZBot)
  - Uses man-in-the-browser keylogging and form grabbing
  - One of the most successful banking trojans
  - Used **fast flax** to evade detection
    - Uses compromised hosts as proxies for commands
    - Idea is to change DNS record of domain very quickly using hundreds of IPs

#### Banking information analysis

- Keylogging
- Form data capture
- Inserting fraudulent form fields
- Screen captures and video recording
- Mimicking financial websites
- Redirecting to banking websites
- Man-in-the-middle attack

##### Tan Gabber

- **Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)**
  - Single use [one-time passwords (OTPs)](./../01-introduction/identity-access-management-(iam).md#one-time-password-otp) to authorize financial transactions
  - E.g. ChipTAN
    - A card needs to be inserted to a device to get the code
    - Used by many German and Austrian banks
- Trojan intercepts the number and replaces it
  - User gets rejected
  - Attacker logs in using target's login details.

##### HTML injection

- Also known as **Webinjects**
- Injects HTML or JavaScript code into e-banking content before it's rendered on a web browser
- üìù Manipulates original forms in bank webpages with additional fields
  - E.g. login credentials, credit card numbers, CVVs, PINs, tokens, etc.
- Goal is to prompt user to give out more information that'll be collected

##### Form Grabber

- Retrieves authorization and log-in credentials from a web forms before they're sent
- More effective than keyloggers as it acquire credentials even if they use virtual keyboard, autofill etc.

##### Covert credential grabber

- Hides itself on a machine
- Searches through session cookies for financial transaction info
- Sends the information the attacker

### Proxy-server trojans

- Allows attacker to use victims computers as proxy to connect to the Internet.
- Starts a hidden proxy server on victim machine
- Used for attackers for illegal activities such as purchasing goods with illegal cards
- E.g. Linux.Proxy.10, [Pinkslipbot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mcafee-releases-free-tool-that-removes-pinkslipbot-leftovers-that-use-your-pc-as-proxy/)

### Defacement trojan

- Resource editors allow to view, edit, extract, and replace strings, bitmaps, logos and icons from any Windows program.
- E.g. changes title of Word documents to "You've been hacked"
- See also [Website defacement | Web threats and attacks](./../12-web-servers/web-server-threats-and-attacks.md#website-defacement)
- E.g. using [Restorator](https://appo.pro/52-restorator-2009.html) to modify files' icons.
