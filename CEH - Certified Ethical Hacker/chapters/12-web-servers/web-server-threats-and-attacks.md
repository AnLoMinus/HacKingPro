# Web server threats and attacks

## DoS/DDoS attacks

- Flooding server with large number of requests to prevent it from functioning properly.
- Services targeted include
  - network bandwidth
  - memory
  - application exception handling mechanism
  - database / hard disk space
  - CPU usage
- DDoS is distributed DoS (denial of service) attack using more than single machine (bots)

## DNS server hijacking

- DNS (Domain Name System)
  - Resolves a domain name to its corresponding IP address when queried.
  - See also [DNS | DNS enumeration](./../04-enumeration/dns-enumeration.md#dns)
- Attacker compromises a DNS server and change its DNS server to redirect clients to a malicious website.
  - E.g. by configuring DNS server to redirect requests to a rogue DNS server.
- E.g. user types in legitimate URL in a browser but browser redirects to a fake banking site.
- See also [DNS poisoning | Sniffing attacks](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-attacks-overview.md#dns-poisoning)

### DNS server hijacking countermeasures

- Deploying [DNSSEC (DNS authentication)](../08-sniffing/sniffing-attacks-overview.md#dnssec-domain-name-system-security-extension)
- Choosing a more secure DNS server
- Using a VPN

## DNS amplification attack

- A DoS attack is to overwhelm the victims DNS server.
- Includes sending large number of requests to DNS server using target websites IP address.
- Query goes through [DNS servers recursively](#recursive-dns-lookup) until DNS server fails to find the mapping.

### Recursive DNS lookup

- Client asks for a mapping DNS server does not have
- DNS server queries further the root DNS server and then caches the results

### DNS amplification attack flow

1. Attacker spoofs and uses victims IP address as source IP
   - All replies from DNS server will be sent to the victims servers
2. Attacker finds internet domain with many DNS records
   - E.g. `subdomain1.cloudarchitecture.io`, `subdomain2.cloudarchitecture.io`, `subdomain3.cloudarchitecture.io`...
3. Attacker sends DNS queries (using bots) to get all records for the domain
   - Results in large replies (usually split over several packets)
   - The replies are sent to the victim.
     - Victims web server becomes too busy with receiving and merging packets and stops functions.
   - **Amplification**
     - For each short DNS query, DNS server replies with larger response
     - Sometimes up to x100 larger, e.g. 3 MBPS DNS queries is amplified as 3000 MBPS DNS replies to victim.

## Directory traversal attacks

- Manipulating the target URL to gain access to restricted directories.
- Attackers may reach to restricted directories using `../`.
- Can be caused by e.g. code vulnerabilities (such as no proper validation), or poorly patched/configured web servers.

## Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

- Intercepting/altering the traffic between an end-user and web servers.
- Done by tricking client into thinking the attacker is the proxy.
- Allows attacker to steal sensitive information.
- This often uses IP spoofing to trick a victim into connecting to the attack.

## Phishing attacks

- Attackers trick an user into visiting a malicious website.
- See also [Phishing |¬†Social Engineering Types](./../10-social-engineering/social-engineering-types.md#phishing)

## Website defacement

- Changing the visual appearance of the target website.
- Attacker can inject malicious code to show e.g. popups/images or change the whole website.
- Usually exposes visitors to some propaganda, or "hacked by ..." message.
- üìù Can be done through e.g.  
  - [SQL injection](./../14-sql-injection/sql-injection-overview.md)
  - [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](./../13-web-applications/owasp-top-10-threats.md#cross-site-scripting-xss)
  - [Malware infection](./../07-malware/malware-overview.md)
  - [DNS cache poisoning](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-attacks-overview.md#dns-poisoning)
  - ...

## Web server misconfiguration

- Configuration weaknesses that are exploited.
- E.g. directory traversal, server intrusion, and data theft.
- E.g. Capital One misconfiguration that led to compromising more than 100 million peoples personal data in 2019 ([read more](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach-hacked.html/))
- "Keeping the server configuration secure requires vigilance"‚Äî OWASP

## HTTP response splitting attack

- Occurs when HTTP headers are generated dynamically using user input.
  - exploits input validation vulnerability.
- Attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application
  - and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header.
- Exploited by injecting new lines into response headers e.g.:
  - Author variable is sent by user such as `Ulle Bulle`
  - Application sets `Set-Cookie author=Ulle Bulle` header in back-end.
  - If user sends following instead (with a newline) he can manipulate the website behavior:

    ```txt
        Ulle Bulle\r\n
        Content-Type: text/html\r\n
        <html>malicious content...</html>
    ```

- Permits variety of attacks such as
  - [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./../13-web-applications/owasp-top-10-threats.md#cross-site-scripting-xss)
  - [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./../13-web-applications/session-hijacking.md#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)
  - [SQL Injection](./../14-sql-injection/sql-injection-overview.md).

### Defend against HTTP response splitting attack

- **Server admin**
  - Use latest web server software.
  - Regularly update/patch OS and Webserver.
  - Run web vulnerability scanners.
- **Application developers**
  - Restrict web application access to unique IPs.
  - Disallow carriage return (%0d or \r) and line feed (%0a or \n) characters.
  - Comply to RFC 2616 specifications for HTTP/1.1.
- **Proxy servers**
  - Avoid sharing incoming TCP connections among different clients.
  - Use different TCP connections with the proxy for different virtual hosts.
  - Implement "maintain request host header" correctly.
  - See also [Proxy servers |¬†Bypassing IDS and firewall](./../03-scanning-networks/bypassing-ids-and-firewall.md#proxy-servers)

## Web cache poisoning

- Replacing cached content with malicious one.
- Possible by
  - Response-caching on server side
  - [HTTP response splitting](#http-response-splitting-attack)

### Web cache poisoning flow

1. Find the service code that vulnerable to filling the HTTP header field with many headers.
2. Force the cache server to flush its actual cache content
   - E.g. by sending `Pragma: no-cache` or `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers in a request.
3. Send a specially crafted request to store in cache
   - Inject malicious code using HTTP response splitting
   - E.g. GET request where encoded URI does the splitting

     ```txt
       GET http://cloudarchitecture.io/redir.php?site=%0d%0aContent-
       Length: %200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aLast-
       Modified: %20Mon,%2027%20Oct%202009%2014:50:18%20GMT%0d%0aConte
       nt-Length: %2020%0d%0aContent-
       Type: %20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<html>deface!</html> HTTP/1.1
       Host: cloudarchitecture.io
       ...
     ```

4. Send the next request.
   - Previously injected content will be the response as it's cached.

## SSH brute force attacks

- Done by cracking SSH login and using SSH tunnels.
- **Flow**
  1. Acquire the SSH login credentials
     1. Port scan to find possible vulnerabilities (e.g. using `nmap`)
     2. Gain login credentials using brute force attack by e.g.
        - Using `metasploit` with `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
        - Using `hydra` as  `hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://172.16.1.102 -t 4`
        - Using custom script in `nmap` e.g. `nmap 172.16.1.102 -p 22 --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=passwords.txt`
  2. Create SSH tunnels between two hosts to transfer exploitations.
- See also [SSH | Tunneling protocols](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell)

## Web server password cracking attacks

- Attacker cracks the target server passwords and uses them to perform new attacks.
- Server password can belong to e.g. SMTP and FTP servers, Web shares, SSH tunnels...
- Attacking methods include social engineering, spoofing, phishing, using a trojan horse or virus, wiretapping, keystroke logging.

## Web application attacks

- Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application code.
- See also [hacking web applications](./../13-web-applications/hacking-web-applications.md)

## Buffer overflow attacks

- Also known as **buffer overrun**
- Anomaly that happens when web server writes data to a buffer in memory that's bigger than buffer size.
  - May cause application crash or other vulnerable behavior.
- Exploited by attacker through sending data in big sizes to the server.
- üìù Example attack against a local server:

  ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python
    import socket

    big_data = 5000 * 'A'
    payload = "TRUN /.:/" + big_data
    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect("10.0.2.4", "9999")
    s.send(payload)
    print "[+] " + str(len(payload)) + " bytes sent"
    s.close()
  ```

- Memory manipulation functions in C and C++ without bound checking are most vulnerable.
  - Higher level languages like Python, Java, and Swift do a better job of protecting against a buffer overflow, but they are still vulnerable.
- Dangerous SQL functions (without checking size of destination buffers) include ‚Ä¢ `gets()` ‚Ä¢¬†`strcpy()` ‚Ä¢ `stract()` ‚Ä¢ `printf()`

### NOP Sled

- Oldest and most common way of exploiting stack buffer overflows
- Sends a large # of NOP instructions into buffer.
- Solves the problem of finding the right place for code execution, as NOPs does nothing and target area is big the execution will slide to no-ops where malicious code will be executed.
- Most IDS protect from this attack.
