# Social engineering types

## Human-based social engineering

### Impersonation

- Also known as ***masquerading***
- üìù Pretending to be someone else to learn needed information
- A form of [identity theft](./social-engineering-overview.md#identity-theft)
- E.g. as
  - target systems end user
  - technical support working with something that requires information to quickly build trust
  - maintenance personal that'll fix vending machine in canteen to install a honeypot
  - an authoritative figure such as FBI agent

### Masquerading

- üìù Pretending to be someone who is authorized and/or requires that access.
- Convincing personnel to grant access to sensitive information or protected systems
- Masquerading is more passive compared to [impersonating](#impersonation).

### Eavesdropping

- üìù Secretly listening other peoples communication without consent.
- E.g. by listening a conversation or reading private messages.

### Shoulder surfing

- üìù Observing victims when they're using devices such as ATMs, computers, kiosks...
- Can be done long distance with vision enhancing devices such as binoculars.
- E.g. looking at the keyboard as target types its password in an Internet caf√©.

### Dumpster diving

- üìù Collecting information from the target's trash bins
- üí° Shredded papers can sometimes indicate sensitive info
- Passive footprinting method
- E.g. bills, financial information, sticky notes, manuals.
- Countermeasure: A safe waste disposal policy

### Reverse social engineering

- üìù Initiated by the victim that's tricked into contacting the attacker herself
- Attacker poses as an authority figure usually by creating a problem then offering a solution.
- E.g.
  - befriending an employee
  - causing problems (e.g. DoS) at work and offer help.
  - often happens with tech support

### Piggybacking

- üìù Convincing an authorized personal to let attacker into a secured area
- Can be physical (e.g. a building) or electronics (e.g. a database)
- Differs from [tailgating](#tailgating) as it includes consent of the personal.
- E.g. "it's a delivery just hold the door" or ""I forgot my ID badge, please help"

### Tailgating

- üìù Gaining access to restricted areas by following another person
- üí° Can hold a fake badge when doing it.
- Usually caused by employee's politeness like opening or holding the door
  - üí° Using a wheelchair usually exploits this human vulnerability
- A countermeasure is using man traps as because they only allow single person at a time.

### Vishing

- Use of the telephone to perform the attack (voice and [phishing](#phishing))

## Computer-based social engineering

### Phishing

- üìù Attack where the attacker sends a link to a malicious website to collect information
- Malicious website usually fakes a legitimate one with a similar URL.
- E.g. someone calls, asks to fill a form, and says it's a company survey and it'll help company a lot.
- URLs are usually sent through e-mail, but can also be sent through:
  - **Spimming** (SPIM=Spam over Instant Messaging)
  - **Spitting** (SPIT=spam over Internet telephony, VoIP spam)

#### Whaling

- üìù A very targeted attack on a high value victim called "Whale" (big fish)
- Usually targets high-level executives

#### Spear Phishing

- üìù Using specialized phishing content for a specific person or group of people
- Generate higher response rate as it's more personalized

#### Pharming

- üìù Redirect a website's traffic to a malicious one
- Can be done through
  - Exploiting DNS vulnerabilities such as [DNS poisoning](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-attacks-overview.md#dns-poisoning)
  - Host file modification
    - Windows location: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
    - Linux location: `/etc/hosts`
    - MacOS X location: `/private/etc/hosts`

#### Phishing countermeasures

##### Detecting phishing e-mails

- Sense of urgency or a veiled threat
- From a bank, company, or social networking site
- Generic greeting
- From a person listed in your email address book
- Malicious attachment
- Official-looking logos
- Offers that seem to be too good to believe
- Links to spoofed websites
- Grammatical/spelling mistakes

##### Anti-phishing tools

- [Netcraft](./../02-footprinting/search-engines-and-online-resources.md#netcraft): maintains malicious site blacklists against phishing.
- [PhishTank](https://phishtank.org/): website containing phishing websites

### Spam mail

- Sent by attacker with malicious links and attachments
- Can get information such as financial information, social security numbers, and network information.

### Baiting

- Installing malware through "need and greed" impulse
- E.g. offering something free if you click a link on a website.

### Pop-up window attacks

- To usually create urge to malicious websites or download malware
- E.g. distribute malware links with message "your machine is infected, click here to clean up"

### Instant chat messenger

- Gathering personal information by chatting with a selected online
- Can get information such as birth dates and maiden names

### Hoax letters

- Emails that issue warnings to the user on new malware that may harm the user's system.

### Chain letters

- Emails that instructs user to forward the mail to the said number of persons
- Usually offer free gifts such as money and software

## Mobile-based social engineering

### Malicious apps

- Created and publish to infect phones and collect data.
- E.g.
  - a replica or similar copy of a popular application
  - ZitMo (ZeuS-in-the-Mobile), a banking malware that was ported to Android

### Repackaging legitimate apps

- Repacking legitimate apps with malware and redistributing in third-party app stores.

### Fake security apps

- Promises security but provides attacker victims data.
- E.g. apps that "victims" victims securely log on to their bank accounts

### SMS phishing

- Also called **SMShishing** or **smishing**
- Sending malicious links through SMS messages and urge their targets to act

## Insider attacks

- Authorized person unintentionally or intentionally compromises the security of a system.
- E.g. spying on competitor company through a job opening to extract information from its employees.
- See also [Insider attacks | Security threats and attacks](./../01-introduction/security-threats-and-attacks.md#insider-attacks).

### Insider types

- **Malicious insiders**
  - Privileged users to inflict harm
  - E.g. dissatisfied or former employees that wants to take revenge
- **Careless and negligent insiders**
  - Make errors and disregard policies
  - E.g. uneducated employees
- **Infiltrators**
  - External actors
  - E.g. hackers
- **Compromised insiders**
  - Allow external threats to act with same privileges as the insider
  - E.g. [Sony breach (2014-15)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack) where attackers took over 100 TBs of data.

## Social engineering countermeasures

- **Training**
  - Employee education to increase awareness
- **Separation and rotation of duties**
  - Employees should sign a statement acknowledging that they understand the policies.
- **Least privilege**
  - Giving a user account only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended job function
  - E.g. a user whose sole job function is to creating backups does not need the ability to install software
    - User account will only have rights to run backup and backup-related applications.
- **Monitoring, logging and auditing**
- **Multi-factor authentication**
  - At least for high risk network services e.g. VPNs, cloud services.
- **Strong password policies**
  - Strong authentication
  - Periodic change
  - Complexity requirements
  - Blocks after failed attempts
- **Physical security policies**
  - Access area restrictions
  - Identification of employees by issuing ID cards, uniforms, etc.
- **Access control**
  - For data through e.g. operational guidelines.
- **Proper incidence response time**
  - Proper guidelines for reacting in case of a social engineering attempt.
- **Change-management process**
  - Better documented
- **Anti-virus and anti-phishing defenses**
- **Background check and proper termination process**
  - Insiders with a criminal background and terminated employees are easy targets for procuring information.
