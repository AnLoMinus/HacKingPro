# Hacking stages

## 1. Reconnaissance

- Also known as **footprinting**, **fingerprinting** or **information gathering**
- üìù Reconnaissance, *noun*, preliminary surveying or research about the target.
- üìù Necessary first step as an attack would not be successful without it.

## 2. Scanning

- Hacker utilizes information from previous stage to conduct more technical scan.
- Often maps the routers and firewalls
- Use tools such as port scanners, network mappers, vulnerability scanners, etc.

### Reconnaissance vs Scanning

- In scanning you're acting on gathered information to gather information
- Examples

| [Reconnaissance](#1-reconnaissance) | [Scanning](#2-scanning) |
| ------ | ----- |
| Scan the perimeter network you need the IP addresses | Use e.g. `nmap` to figure out what the configuration is. |
| Get e-mails. | Use phishing to gather personal data |
| Learn where service physically are | Do dumpster diving |

## 3. Gaining Access

- Attack stage
- Steps:
  1. Find an entry point to the target OS or application on the system
  2. Use it to perform the attack
     - Hackers may escalate privileges to gain complete control over the system/network.
- Examples:
  - Password crack with brute-force or dictionary attack
  - Exploit buffer overflow
  - Session hijack
  - DoS attacks

## 4. Maintaining Access

- Keeping admin/root privileges so hacker can continue using the system.
  - After breaking into a system, you attempt to elevate privileges to do more.
- Maintain persistent access, because your connection might break, then you start again
- Can prevent other hackers from accessing the system by installing backdoors, rootkits, or trojans.
- üí° You can install tools to give you persistance access and gathers data to use compromise more such as keylogger.
- üí° You can use the machine as proxy so all traces are lead back to the proxy.
  - You can minimize the risks being discovered this way.
  - ‚ùó As pen-tester document those as you'll get other people in trouble

## 5. Clearing tracks

- Hackers do everything they can do to hide their activities
- Goal is to maintain the access to the system but remain unnoticed in the process.
  - If you're detected: the vulnerability will be patched and you'll lose access.
- Vital to clear all tracks as fast as possible, or if it's possible generate none.
- Activities:
  - Clear certain entries in log files: Not all, or it'll be suspicious
  - Masquerade your activities: Make them as similar as possible as legitimate activities
    - E.g. a good keylogger masquerade itself behind legitimate activities
      - Mimics other programs behavior by adding more behavior.
