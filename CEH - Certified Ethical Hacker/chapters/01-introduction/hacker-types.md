## White hat hackers

- Also known as **ethical hackers**

### Ethical hacking

- Also known as white hat hacking

  - Helps them analyzing and strengthening their system and network security
  - Allows for creating preventive measures that should prevent any future security breaches as well as protect data and information stored in the system.
- Difference from black-hat hacking:
  - Hacking with permission of system owner
  - They remain compliant to the law
  - Purpose is to prevent hackers from breaking into systems and networks.
- Flow
  1. Find vulnerabilities
  2. Assess problems & threats about them
  3. Offer solutions e.g. you can do to fix this
  4. Inform within the company
- Ethical hackers should ask themselves when evaluating a system: (also companies asks often "why would we fix it?" in three questions)
  - What is it that an attacker can see on this network/system?
  - What could the attacker do with that knowledge?
  - Are there any traces of attempted attacks on the system/network?

### Ethical hacking scope

- No test should be performed without appropriate permissions and authorization.
- Test results should be kept confidential
- Only those tests that the client requested should be performed
