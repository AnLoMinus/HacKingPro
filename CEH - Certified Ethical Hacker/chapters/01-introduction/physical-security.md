# Physical security

- The protection of all assets of an organization from all sorts of threats and attacks.
- Helps in
  - Preventing unauthorized access to the system
  - Preventing any kind of data manipulation and theft
  - Protecting the system against malicious activities such as espionage, damage and theft
  - Protecting employees and preventing social engineering attacks
- Categories
  - **Natural or environmental threats**
    - E.g. flood, fire, earthquake, dust
  - **Man-made threats**
    - E.g. Terrorism, wars, explosions, [dumpster diving](./../10-social-engineering/social-engineering-types.md#dumpster-diving) and theft, vandalism.

## Types of physical security controls

### Preventive controls

- Implemented before a threat event to reduce or avoid its impact.
- Includes access control mechanisms to prevent access
- Can be **technical** e.g.
  - Firewalls
  - Authentication systems.
- Can be **administrative** e.g.
  - Security policies
- üìù Can be **physical** e.g.
  - Fire extinguishers
  - Doors e.g.
    - **Mantrap**
      - Also known as air lock, sally port or access control vestibule
      - Has two doors, each door requiring a separate form of authentication to open
    - **Turnstile**
      - Also known as a turnpike, baffle gate, automated gate
      - Allows one person to pass at a time, can enforce one day direction
      - Can require a a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar
      - E.g. in train stations
  - **Bollard**
    - Sturdy, short, vertical post
    - Used for control road traffic and posts
    - Allows to prevent ram-raiding and vehicle-ramming attacks.
    - ü§ó Used initially for mooring boats

#### Static electricity

- Low humidity can cause a buildup of static electricity.
  - Leads to corrosion of the components could.
  - üí° Keep humidity level between 45% and 55%.
- Grounding systems help
  - E.g. antistatic wrist straps are designed to ground people appropriately
  - Provides somewhere for any latent static electricity generated to flow.

### Detective controls

- In place to let you know when something has happened or is happening.  
- Detects violations and intrusion attempts for investigation.
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ audit trails and logging ‚Ä¢ alarm systems ‚Ä¢ sensors ‚Ä¢ video surveillance ‚Ä¢ motion detectors.

### Deterrent controls

- Also known as **deterrence controls**
- Warns intruders to stay away
- E.g. signs showing ‚Ä¢ "Be aware of the dog" ‚Ä¢ "Under surveillance" ‚Ä¢ "Authorized personal only"

### Recovery controls

- Used after violation has happened to restore the system to its persistent state
- E.g. backup systems and disaster recovery

### Compensation controls

- Do not prevent attacks, used when everything else fails
- Goal is to restore everything back to normal
- E.g. when there's power shortage you need a grid, alternative energy backing: generators, batteries..

## Physical security measures

- Secure premises and company surroundings
- Secure the reception area
- Lock servers and workstations when not in use
- Lock devices such as modems, removable media, and fax machines when not in use
- Implement access control
- Regularly maintain computer equipment
- Prevent wiretapping
- Monitor the environment by checking the humidity and temperature
- Positive pressure is great at keeping contaminants (e.g. dust, dirt) out of the data center
