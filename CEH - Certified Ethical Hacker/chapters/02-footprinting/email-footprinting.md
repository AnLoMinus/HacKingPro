# Email footprinting

- By monitoring the email delivery and inspecting the e-mail headers
- Information includes
  - IP address of the recipient
  - Geolocation of the recipient
  - Delivery information
  - Visited links
  - Browser and OS information
  - Reading time
- Can track emails using various **email tracking tools**
  - E.g. notifies sender of the email being delivered and opened by the recipient
  - Used by marketers, sellers etc.

## Email header analysis

- Helps to determine an e-mail contains something malicious or not
- Email-headers include
  - Sender's name
  - IP/Email address of the sender
  - Mail server
  - Mail server authentication system
  - Send and delivery stamps
  - Unique number of the message

### Authentication protocol headers

- Allows you to detect forged sender addresses.
- The goal is for sender to identify itself to the receiver.
- E-mail headers include information about their pass status

#### SPF: Sender Policy Framework

- E.g. `'PASS' with IP 209.85.220.69` or `'NEUTRAL' ...`
- Verifies if the domain of the e-mail owned by the sending server.
  - If not passed, many e-mail providers just block it.
- Based on e-mail servers who publish records and says "here's the IP addresses we'll send e-mails"

#### DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail

- E.g. `'PASS' with domain accounts.google.com`
- Allows the receiver to verify that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was authorized by the owner of that domain using a digital signature on the domain.

#### DMARC: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance

- E.g. `PASS` or `FAIL`
- Combination of two protocols SPF + DKIM
- It builds on them and adds more policy

## Verifying email legitimacy

- Double check `FROM`
- Check the spelling in domain name so it's coming from the domain of the company
  - If it's random e-mail check if it's from one of the biggest domain providers or if something legit.
- Check IP of the domain
  - It can be someones computer (home router IP) or a private server
  - Major mail service providers checks to determine if domain of the e-mail is tied to the source IP of the e-mail (e.g. have a record)
    - ðŸ¤— You can tie a public WiFi (e.g. coffee shop) IP to domain and send the e-mails from there.

## E-mail policies

- Different e-mail service provider have different policies regarding to their SMTP
- ðŸ’¡ Once hacker recognizes e-mail servers then then he/she can create accounts there, send e-mails back and further to figure out what the rules are.
- E.g. google does not allow you to see the IP address of the sender
  - They proxy it behind one of their servers
  - Workarounds are not so efficient.
- Each have own ruling list
  - Determines e.g. what kind of files that can be send

## Getting an IP address from an e-mail

- You can then get IP and a lot from browser headers including
  - browser information, OS info, device types
  - Revealing your IP is not safe as even home routers have pretty static IP addresses
    - Last usually 30 days up to 3 months
    - ðŸ’¡ You can still release DHCP lease in your home router settings to get a new IP from the ISP.
- You can send an image from a back-end server that you own
  - Some e-mail providers request it and hide users IP
- You can send a direct link
  - No e-mail provider can protect you from that
  - ðŸ¤— Can be done through social engineering e.g.
    - You know from social media that Bob was celebrating yesterday. You send an e-mail stating "Hi Bob, crew and I had a great time last night, you're never going to guess what Sam did in toilet, threw himself up, check out his pictures"
  - E.g.
    1. Install apache `yum install httpd`
    2. Start apache `systemctl start httpd`
    3. Create a file: `cd /var/www/html/` then `touch <RESOURCE_NAME>;`
    4. Check logs live: `tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log`
    5. You'll get the IP address when the link (`<IP_ADDRESS>/<RESOURCE_NAME>`) is opened
       - You can find out self IP address using `curl ifconfig.me`
    6. And you can look at the location of IP using `geoiplookup <IP_ADDRESS>;`
