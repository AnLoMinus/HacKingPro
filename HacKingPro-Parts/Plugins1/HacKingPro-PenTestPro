## Different Types Of Penetration Testing
### Each type of penetration test requires specific knowledge, methodologies, and tools:




Client_Side(){
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
}
Network_Service(){
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
  echo "Network Service"
  echo "
  In this type of pen testing, the physical structure of the system is checked primarily to identify risks in the network of the organization.
  In this testing, the penetration tester performs tests in the organization’s network and tries to find out flaws in the design, operation, or implementation of the respective company’s network.
  Various components of the organization such as
    - Computers
    - Modems
    - Remote Access Devices
  Are all checked by the tester to exploit the possible vulnerabilities.


  "
}
Physical(){
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
  echo "Physical"
  echo "
  This method of physical penetration testing is done to simulate the real-world threats.
  The pen tester acts as a cyber-attacker and tries to break the physical barrier of security.
  This test is done to check for the vulnerabilities in physical controls like
    - Security Cameras
    - Lockers
    - Bbarriers
    - Sensors
    - etc

"
}
Social_Engineering(){
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
}
Web_Application(){
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
  echo "Web Application"
  echo "
  This method of pen testing is done to check vulnerabilities or weaknesses within web-based applications.
  The web penetration testing looks out for any security issues that might occur due to insecure development due to design or code and identified potential vulnerabilities within websites and web apps.
  This type of testing is most needed for
    - Online Shopping Websites
    - Banking apps
    - Other eCommerce websites which deal with online transactions.

}
Wireless(){
  clear
  echo "Penetration Testing Bible"
  echo "Wireless"
  echo "
  This form of pen testing is done to examine the connection between all devices like
    - Laptops,
    - Computers,
    - Tablets,
    - Smart-Phones,
    - etc, that are connected to the organization’s Wifi.
  This form of pen testing is done to prevent any data leakage that can happen while sharing data from one device to another device through the Wifi network.

  ## Why Should You Perform A Wireless Penetration Test?

  Wireless communications are an invisibly running service that allows data to flow in and out of the network.
  Therefore, this wireless network must be secured from any weaknesses like unauthorized access or data leakage.

  ### Before performing a wireless penetration test you should consider the following:

  - Have all access points been identified and how many use poor encryption methods?
  - Is the data flowing in and out of the network encrypted and if so, how?
  - Are there monitoring systems in place to identify unauthorized users?
  - Is there any possibility the IT team could have misconfigured or duplicated a wireless network?
  - What are the current measures in place to protect the wireless network?
  - Are all wireless access points using WPA protocol?
