    - [ ] [FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon): FinalRecon is an automatic web reconnaissance tool written in python. Goal of FinalRecon is to provide an overview of the target in a short amount of time while maintaining the accuracy of results. Instead of executing several tools one after another it can provide similar results keeping dependencies small and simple.
