- How transactions are managed on a blockchain?
  - Transactions are grouped in units
  - units are nothing but blocks
  - first block is known as Genesis block. Always starts with block 0.
  - There are other properties of the transactions which gets stored on the block:
    - timestamp
    - hash values of the data on the block
    - each time the data get appended to the block hash of the block gets changed. Basically creating hash of the block using simple hashing algorithms. 
    - PrviousBlockHash property is the most important concept to create a chain.
    - each block in the chain stores the hash value of the previous block. Hence creating the chain.
    
- How nodes/peer maintain integrity?
  - Each nodes/peers in the blockchain who helps with the transactions can check the hash values of the previous block. if during comparison hash value is different then the chain has been tampered and invalidates the transactions. If the hash values matches the transaction is performed.
  - The hash calculations are done from current block hash to block 0. 
  - the whole chain integrity is checked before performing any transactions.
  - if there is a mismatch at any stage of the chain then the tamper is detected and the transaction is invalidated.
