<h1>Wi-Fi Penetration Testing Tools and Techniques<h1><br>
<h3>Available Tools/Framework</h3><br>

<li><b>Aircrack-Ng:</b> Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:<br>

- Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.<br>
- Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.<br>
- Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).<br>
- Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).<br>

<li><b>WEPCrack:</b>WEPCrack is an open source security tool to break 802.11 WEP encryption security keys.<br>

<li><b>coWPAtty:</b>Implementation of an offline dictionary attack against WPA/WPA2 networks using PSK-based authentication (e.g. WPA-Personal). Many enterprise networks deploy PSK-based authentication mechanisms for WPA/WPA2 since it is much easier than establishing the necessary RADIUS, supplicant and certificate authority architecture needed for WPA-Enterprise authentication. Cowpatty can implement an accelerated attack if a precomputed PMK file is available for the SSID that is being assessed.<br>
