SMB Login is very useful technique when performing password spraying. Generally when an attacker obtains the list of usernames within domain controller we use this method to see if any user is using common password to authenticate to the domain.

Note:
   - check for password policy before running smb login
   - check for account lockout policy
   - Check for auto account reset (generally in minutes)
   - try one password every x minutes
