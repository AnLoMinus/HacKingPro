- Note: This is a semi-untethered jailbreak which means it's a hybrid between an untethered jailbreak and a tethered jailbreak. This requires you to re-run the jailbreak tool every time you reboot your device. Also, the jailbreak expires in 7 days. Repeat the whole process to jailbreak the device again.
