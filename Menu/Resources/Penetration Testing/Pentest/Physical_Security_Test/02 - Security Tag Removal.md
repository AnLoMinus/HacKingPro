- Security Tags:
As an anti-theft measure, clothing stores tag certain items with security tags so you'll set off an alarm when you leave with the tag still on the garment or ruin it by spilling ink from the tag if you try to remove it yourself.

<B>Note: Don't shoplift. It's not a nice thing to do, and it's illegal.</B>

<B>Method to remove the tag</B>:

- Use the neodymium magnets and run on the top of the security tag.
- The back screw should pop right out.
- Pin should have some groves on it to grasp it inside the tag.
- Happy hacking!
