<B>Things Needed: </B>
  - Air Duster
  - PIR motion sensor
  
<B>General Idea:</B>
Using air duster (canned air) to set off the PIR (passive infrared) motion sensor from the outside.

The straw of these cans easily slips through most doors and allows you to aim the canister, while the output (technically not air, but typically a chemical such as difluoroethane) alters the temperature or amount of longwave infrared light that the sensor can detect, thus causing the sensor to believe there is motion, and unlocking the door from the outside.
