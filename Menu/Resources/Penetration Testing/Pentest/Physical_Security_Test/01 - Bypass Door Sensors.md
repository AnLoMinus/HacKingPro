- Reed Switch: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch

- Bypass Method: These sensors are made of two parts a fixed part and a mobile part. The fix part contains a circuit, and battery and something called "reed switch". This switch is very small and it lets electricity pass when a magnetic field is near, that's why the mobile part of the switch is in fact a magnet.

The main weakness of this device is it's dependence of a magnetic field. You can use a stronger magnet to keep the switch "on" even the mobile part (containing the smaller magnet) is removed. Of course the attacker must know the exact position of the sensor in order to open the door or window without triggering the alarm.

- Ways to protect:
  - install the switch on a metal surface, if the door it's not made of metal, mount it on a small iron plate. The metal will absorb most of the magnetic field coming from the side
  - hide the sensor when people can not see it's location
