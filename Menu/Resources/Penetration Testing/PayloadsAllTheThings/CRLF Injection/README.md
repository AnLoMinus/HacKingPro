# CRLF

>The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in todayâ€™s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. In the HTTP protocol, the CR-LF sequence is always used to terminate a line.

>A CRLF Injection attack occurs when a user manages to submit a CRLF into an application. This is most commonly done by modifying an HTTP parameter or URL.

Using UTF-8 encoding

```http

```

Remainder:

* %E5%98%8A = %0A = \u560a
* %E5%98%8D = %0D = \u560d
* %E5%98%BE = %3E = \u563e (>)
* %E5%98%BC = %3C = \u563c (<)


## Exploitation Tricks
* Try to search for parameters that lead to redirects and fuzz them
* Also test the mobile version of the website, sometimes it is different or uses a different backend
