# Lateral Movement with Psexec

A very old and noisy lateral movement technique can be performed using psexec by SysInternals.

## Execution

Let's connect from workstation `ws01` to the domain controller `dc01` with domain administractor credentials:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@victim" %}
```text
.\PsExec.exe -u administrator -p 123456 \\dc01 cmd
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Observations

The technique is noisy for at least a couple of reasons. Upon code execution, these are some well known artefacts that are left behind which will most likely get you flagged in an environment where SOC is present.

A `psexesvc` service gets created on the remote system and below shows the process ancestry of your command shell:

Proving that `psexec` is actually running as a service:

Additionally, there is quite a bit of SMB network traffic generated when connecting to a remote machine which could be signatured:
