# Word Library Add-Ins

It' possible to persist in the userland by abusing word library add-ins by putting your malicious DLL into a Word's trusted location. Once the DLL is there, the Word will load it next time it is opened.

## Execution

Get trusted locations:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@victim" %}
```csharp
 Get-ChildItem "hkcu:\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security\Trusted Locations"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Those trusted locations are actually defined in Word's Security Center if you have access to the GUI:

Let's create a simple DLL that will launch a notepad.exe once DLL is attached:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/annotation-2019-06-22-143558.png)

Compile the DLL and copy it over to `Startup` folder and rename it to `evilm64.wll`:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/annotation-2019-06-22-121537.png)

```text
mv .\evilm64.dll .\evilm64.wll
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/annotation-2019-06-22-144024%20%281%29.png)

Next time the victim opens up Word, `evilm64.wll` will be loaded and executed:

Interesting to note that Process Explorer does not see the evilm64.wll loaded in any of the currently running processes:

...although we can definitely see that the add-in is now recognized by Word:

**Interesting**  
This technique did not work for me on Office 365 version, but worked on Office Professional. Not sure if there's a bug in the 365 version or it's just a limitation of that version.
{% endhint %}
