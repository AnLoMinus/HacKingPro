# Unloading Sysmon Driver

## Execution

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@victim" %}
```text
fltMC.exe unload SysmonDrv
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Observations

Windows event logs suggesting `SysmonDrv` was unloaded successfully:

As well as processes requesting special privileges:

Note how in the last 35 minutes since the driver was unloaded, no further process creation events were recorded, although I spawned new processes during that time:

Note how the system thinks that the sysmon is still running, which it is, but not doing anything useful:
