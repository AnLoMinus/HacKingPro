# Testing tools

- Program to detect the existence of remote / local stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities (FTP, IMAP, POP3 and SMTP): https://github.com/iricartb/buffer-overflow-vulnerability-services-tester-tool

# Generating Random Patterns
```
locate pattern_create
pattern_create.rb 2700
pattern_offset.rb 39624438
```

# Bad characters

* Use all hex combinations and append that to buffer (\x01\x02)

# Finding Gadgets

## When main program is not memory protected
EDB  -> Op code searcher

Example : ESP -> EIP

## When main program is memory protected
- Find a var that loads a memory location into and offset that     
- Find a module with no memory protection and memory module address (base) does not contain any bad characters
```
!mona modules
```
  - Open modules and open the selected module  (e)
  - Search for a instructions
    - JUMP ESP
    - PUSH ESP
    - RTN

- If not found look at modules list (m) and check in other sections (if DEP or ASLR is not enabled)

```
nasm_shell
  > jmp esp (to get get opcode)
  > FF E4

!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m slmfc.dll
```
