Universal Radio Hacker: investigate wireless protocols like a boss

```
- hardware interfaces for common Software Defined Radios
- easy demodulation of signals
- assigning participants to keep overview of your data
- customizable decodings to crack even sophisticated encodings like CC1101 data whitening
- assign labels to reveal the logic of the protocol
- fuzzing component to find security leaks
- modulation support to inject the data back into the system
- simulation environment to perform stateful attacks
```
