# Chapter 8 - Reverse Engineering

> Reverse engineering is taking apart an object to see how it works in order to duplicate or enhance the object. The practice, taken from older industries, is now frequently used on computer hardware and software. Software reverse engineering involves reversing a program's machine code back into the source code that it was written in, using program language statements.
