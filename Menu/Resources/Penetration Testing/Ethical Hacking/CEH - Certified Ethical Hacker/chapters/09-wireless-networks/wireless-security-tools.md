# Wireless security tools

## Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS)

- Also known as **Wireless IPS**
- Network device
- üìù Intrusion detection by monitoring the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized access points (e.g. evil twins)
- Intrusion prevention by taking steps to mitigate the threat (e.g. deattaching it).
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ [Cisco Adaptive Wireless IPS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/adaptive-wireless-ips-software/index.html)¬†‚Ä¢¬†[WatchGuard WIPS](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/access-points/wips)

### Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS)

- Also known as **Wireless IDS**
