# Malwares

> ‚ö°Ô∏é **This chapter has [practical labs](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/tree/master/6-Malware)**

### - **What is Malware?**
*Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server or computer network. The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer user.*

## <u>Types of Viruses and Worms üêõ </u>
* **How it works?**
  1. Infection Phase - a virus planted on a target system and replicates itself and attaches to one or more executable files
  2. Attack phase - the infected file is executed accidentally by the user, or in some way is deployed and activated

- **Virus** - Designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. They cannot reproduce/spread without help. They operate by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document in order to execute its code.

- **Macro Virus** - Written in a macro language (e.g: VBA) and that is platform independent. 

- **Compression Viruses** - Another type of virus that appends itself to executables on the system and compresses them by user's permissions.

- **Stealth Virus** - Hides the modifications it has made; Trick antivirus software; intercepting its requests to the OS and provides false and bogus information.

- **Polymorphic Virus** - Produces varied but operational copies of itself. A polymorphic virus may have no parts that remain identifcal between infections, making it very hard to detect using signatures.

- **Multipart Virus** - Attempts to infect both boot sector and files; generally refers to viruses with multiple infection methods

- **Self-garbling (metamorphic) virus** - Rewrites itself every time it infects a new file.

- **Other Virus Types**
  - **Boot Sector Virus** - known as system virus; moves boot sector to another location and then inserts its code int he original location
  - **Shell Virus** - wraps  around an application's code, inserting itself before the application's
  - **Cluster Virus** - modifies directory table entries so every time a file or folder is opened, the virus runs
  - **Encryption Virus** - uses  encryption to hide the code from antivirus
  - **Cavity Virus** - overwrite portions of host files as to not increase the actual size of the file; uses null content sections
  - **Sparse Infector Virus** - only infects occasionally (e.g. every 10th time)
  - **File Extension Virus** - changes the file extensions of files to take advantage of most people having them turned off (readme.txt.vbs shows as readme.txt)

- **Virus Makers**
  - Sonic Bat
  - PoisonVirus Maker
  - Sam's Virus Generator
  - JPS Virus Maker

- **Worm** - self-replicating malware that sends itself to other computers without human intervention
  - Usually doesn't infect files - just resides in active memory
  - Often used in botnets

- **Ghost Eye Worm** - hacking tool that uses random messaging on Facebook and other sites to perform a host of malicious efforts.

- **Logic Bomb** - Executes a program when a certain event happens or a date and time arrives.

- **Rootkit** - Set of malicious tools that are loaded on a compromised system through stealthy techniques; Very hard to detect; 

- **Ransomware** - malicious software designed to deny access to a computer until a price is paid; usually spread through email
  - **WannaCry** - famous ransomware; within 24 hours had 230,000 victims; exploited unpatched SMB vulnerability
    - **Other Examples**
      - Cryptorbit
      - CryptoLocker
      - CryptoDefense
      - police-themed

- **Trojan horse** - A program that is disguised as another legitimate program with the goal of carrying out malicious activities in the background without user's knowledge.
  - **RAT - Remote Access Trojans** - Malicious programs that run on systems and allow intruders to access and use a system remotely.

- **Immunizer** - Attaches code to a file or application, which would fool a virus into 'thinking' it was already infected. (e.g: like human vaccine).

- **Behavior blocking** - Allowing the suspicious code to execute within the OS and watches its interactions looking for suspicious activities.

> **Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è - Viruses needs help/interaction to propagate; Worms self propagates**

### Major characteristics of viruses:
1. Infecting other files
2. Alteration of data
3. Transforms itself
4. Corruption of files and data
5. Encrypts itself
6. Self-replication

### Stages of Virus Lifecycle:
1. Design
2. Replication
3. Launch
4. Detection 
5. Incorporation - A.V. figures out the virus pattern & builds signatures to identify and eliminate the virus
6. Execution of the damage routine - A.V. to the rescue

## <u>Malware Basics</u>
* **How is malware distributed?**
  - SEO manipulation
  - Social Engineering / Click-jacking
  - Phishing
  - Malvertising
  - Compromising legitimate sites
  - Drive-by downloads
  - Spam

- **Malware** - software designed to harm or secretly access a computer system without informed consent
  - Most is downloaded from the Internet with or without the user's knowledge

- **Overt Channels** - legitimate communication channels used by programs

- **Covert Channels** - used to transport data in unintended ways

- **Wrappers** - programs that allow you to bind an executable to an innocent file

### **Basic components of Malware**
1. **Crypters** - use a combination of encryption and code manipulation to render malware undetectable to security programs; protects from being scanned or found during analysis.

2. **Downloader** - Used to download additional malware.

3. **Dropper** - Used to install additional malware into the target system.

4. **Exploit** - Malicious code used to execute on a specific vulnerability.

5. **Injector** - Used to expose vulnerable processes in the target system to the exploit.

6. **Obfuscator** - Used to conceal the true purpose of the malware.

7. **Packers** - Used to bundle all of the malware files together into a single executable.

8. **Payload** - Used to take over the target machine.

9. **Malicious Code** - Used to define the abilities of the malware.

**Exploit Kits** - help deliver exploits and payloads
- Infinity
- Bleeding Life
- Crimepack
- Blackhole Exploit Kit

## <u>Trojans üê¥</u>

- Software that appears to perform a desirable function but instead performs malicious activity
  - To hackers, it is a method to gain and maintain access to a system
  - Trojans are means of delivery whereas a backdoor provides the open access
  - Trojans are typically spread through **Social Engineering**.

- **Types of Trojans:**
  - **Defacement trojan**
  - **Proxy server trojan**
  - **Botnet trojan**
    - Chewbacca
    - Skynet
  - **Remote access trojans**
    - RAT
    - MoSucker
    - Optix Pro
    - Blackhole
  - **E-banking trojans**
    - Zeus
    - Spyeye
  - **IoT Trojans**
  - **Security Software Disable Trojans**
  - **Command Shell Trojan** - Provides a backdoor to connect to through command-line access
    - Netcat
  - **Covert Channel Tunneling Trojan** (CCTT) - a RAT trojan; creates data transfer channels in previously authorized data streams

### Infection Process:
1. Creation of a Trojan using Trojan Construction Kit
2. Create a Dropper
    - Used to install additional malware into the target system.
3. Create a Wrapper
    - Wrappers - programs that allow you to bind an executable to an innocent file
4. Propagate the Trojan
5. Execute the Dropper

> **‚ö†Ô∏è - Its not necessary to know every possible trojan port in the history for the CEH exam, it's good for understanding.**

### **Trojan Countermeasures**
1. Avoid cicking on unusual or suspect email attachments
2. Block unused ports
3. Monitor network traffic
4. Avoid downloading from unstrusted sources
5. Install & updated anti-virus software
6. Scan removable media before use
7. Validate file integrity of all externally sourced software
8. Enable auditing
9. Configure Host-Based firewalls
10. Use IDS

### Techniques
- **`netstat -an`** - shows open ports in numerical order
- **`netstat -b`** - displays all active connections and the processes using them
- **Process Explorer** - Microsoft tool that shows you everything about running processes
- **Registry Monitoring Tools**
  - SysAnalyzer
  - Tiny Watcher
  - Active Registry Monitor
  - Regshot
- **Msconfig** - Windows program that shows all programs set to start on startup
- **Tripwire** - integrity verifier that can act as a HIDS in protection against trojans
- **SIGVERIF** - build into Windows to verify the integrity of the system
  - Log  file can be found at `c:\windows\system32\sigverif.txt`
  - Look for drivers that are not signed

## <u>Malware Analysis</u>
*Malware analysis is the study or process of determining the functionality, origin and potential impact of a given malware sample such as a virus, worm, trojan horse, rootkit, or backdoor.*
### **Types of Malware analysis:**
1. **Static (Code Analysis)** - performed by fragmenting the binary file into individual elements that can be analyzed without executing them.
    - File fingerprinting
    - Local & online scanning of elements to see if they match known malware profiles
    - String searching
    - Identifying packers/obfuscators used
    - Identifying the PE's (portable executable) information
    - Identify dependencies
    - Malware disassembly

2. **Dynamic (Behavioral Analysis)** - performed by executing the malware to see what effect it has on the system.
    -  System baselining
    - Host integrity monitoring
- **Tools for Disassembling | Debugging | Reverse Engineering:**
  - IDA Pro
  - OllyDdg 
  - Ghidra by NSA

- **Sheepdip** - Dedicated computer which is used to test files on removable media for viruses before they are allowed to be used with other computers.

### **Steps**
1. Make sure you have a good test bed
    - Use a VM with NIC in host-only mode and no open shares
2. Analyze the malware on the isolated VM in a static state
    - Tools - binText and UPX help with looking at binary
3. Run the malware and check out processes
    - Use Process Monitor, etc. to look at processes
    - Use NetResident, TCPview or even Wireshark to look at network activity
4. Check and see what files were added, changed, or deleted
    - Tools - IDA Pro, VirusTotal, Anubis, Threat Analyzer

- **Preventing Malware**
  - Make sure you know what is going on in your system
  - Have a good antivirus that is up to date
    - Airgapped - isolated on network


## <u>Rootkits</u>

- Software put in place by attacker to obscure system compromise
- Hides processes and files
- Also allows for future access
- **Examples**
  - Horsepill - Linus kernel rootkit inside initrd
  - Grayfish - Windows rootkit that injects in boot record
  - Firefef - multi-component family of malware
  - Azazel
  - Avatar
  - Necurs
  - ZeroAccess
- **Hypervisor level** - rootkits that modify the boot sequence of a host system to load a VM as the host OS
- **Hardware** - hide malware in devices or firmware
- **Boot loader level** - replace boot loader with one controlled by hacker
- **Application level** - directed to replace valid application files with Trojans
- **Kernel level** - attack boot sectors and kernel level replacing kernel code with back-door code; most dangerous
- **Library level** - use system-level calls to hide themselves
- One way to detect rootkits is to map all the files on a system and then boot a system from a clean CD version and compare the two file systems
