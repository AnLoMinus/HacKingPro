# Malware Analysis Virtual Environment

## REMnux
REMnuxÂ® is a free Linux toolkit for assisting malware analysts with reverse-engineering malicious software. It strives to make it easier for forensic investigators and incident responders to start using the variety of freely-available tools that can examine malware, yet might be difficult to locate or set up.

The heart of the project is the REMnux Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. This lightweight distro incorporates many tools for analyzing Windows and Linux malware, examining browser-based threats such as obfuscated JavaScript, exploring suspicious document files and taking apart other malicious artifacts. Investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab when performing behavioral malware analysis.

### Setup the Flare VM Environment
The process is very simple, make sure to download the FLARE VM on [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm) by FireEye, and the [Windows 7 virtual machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).

The setup is very easy, just fire up your fresh new Windows 7 VM and install the Flare VM PS scripts. I separeted some useful links on setting up the FLARE VM.
