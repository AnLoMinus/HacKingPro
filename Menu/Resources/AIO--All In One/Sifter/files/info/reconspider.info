ReconSpider
*************
ReconSpider is an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Framework for scanning IP Address, Emails, Websites, Organizations and find out information from different sources.

ReconSpider can be used by Infosec Researchers, Penetration Testers, Bug Hunters and Cyber Crime Investigators to find deep information about their target.

ReconSpider aggregate all the raw data, visualize it on a dashboard and facilitate alerting and monitoring on the data.

Recon Spider also combines the capabilities of Photon and Recon Dog to do a comprehensive enumeration of attack surface.

Why it's called ReconSpider ?
*****************************
ReconSpider = Recon + Spider

Recon = Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is a mission to obtain information by various detection methods, about the activities and resources of an enemy or potential enemy, or geographic characteristics of a particular area.

		IP >> 8.8.8.8


2. URL

	This option gathers all the information of given URL Address from public sources and give you in depth-information of IP address, country, city, organization, ISP, open ports and so more.

	ReconSpider >> 2
		URL >> vulnweb.com


3. WHOIS

	This option allows you to search for domain name availability and WHOIS information including name, organisation, address, city, country, zipcode, registrar, name servers etc.

	ReconSpider >> 3
		WHOIS (URL) >> google.com


4. DNS MAP

	This option allows you to map an organizations attack surface with a virtual DNS Map of the DNS records associated with the target organization.

	ReconSpider >> 4
		DNS MAP (URL) >> vulnweb.com


5. PORT SCAN

	This option allows you to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

	ReconSpider >> 5
		PORT SCAN (URL / IP) >> vulnweb.com


6. NS LOOKUP

	This option allows you to obtain information about internet servers. It finds name server information for domains by querying the Domain Name System.

	ReconSpider >> 6
		NS LOOKUP (URL) >> google.com


7. HONEYPOT

	This option allows you to identify honeypots! The probability that an IP is a honeypot is captured in a "Honeyscore" value that can range from 0.0 to 1.0

	ReconSpider >> 7
		HONEYPOT (IP) >> 1.1.1.1


8. UPDATE
