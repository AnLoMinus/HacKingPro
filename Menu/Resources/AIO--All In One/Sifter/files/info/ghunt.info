To configure upon first runtime you will need 4 cookies from an existing gmail address!!

[!] Where I find these 4 cookies ?

    1. Log in to accounts.google.com
    
    2. After that, open the Dev Tools window and navigate to the Storage tab (Shift + F9 on Firefox) (It's called "Application" on Chrome)
    
    3. If you don't know how to open it, just right-click anywhere and click "Inspect Element".
    
    4. Then you'll find every cookie you need, including the 4 ones.

An additional image is provided in order to show you where to look.
Just match the cookies to the ones asked for.
