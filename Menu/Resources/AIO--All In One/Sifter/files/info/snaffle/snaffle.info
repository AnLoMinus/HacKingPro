# Snaffler

[!] What is it for?
[*] Snaffler is a tool for pentesters to help find delicious 
	candy needles (creds mostly, but it's flexible) in a bunch 
	of horrible boring haystacks (a massive Windows/AD environment).

	It might also be useful for other people doing other stuff, 
	but it is explicitly NOT meant to be an "audit" tool.

[!] # Example Usage:

	> snaffler.exe -s -o snaffler.log


[!] What does it do?
[*] It gets a list of Windows computers from Active Directory, 
	then spreads out its snaffly appendages to them all to figure 
	out which ones have file shares, and whether you can read them.

	Then YET MORE snaffly appendages enumerate all the files in those 
	shares and use LEARNED ARTIFACTUAL INTELLIGENCE for MACHINES to 
	figure out which ones a grubby little hacker like you might want.


[!][!] Actually it doesn't do any ML stuff (yet)! 
[*]	because doing that right would require training data, and that 
	would require an enormous amount of time that we don't have.


# How do I use it?

[!] If you "literally just run the EXE on a domain joined machine in the context 
	of a domain user" (as people were instructed to do with Grouper2, immediately 
	before they ran it with all the verbose/debug switches on so it screamed several 
	hundred megabytes of stack traces at them) it will basically do nothing. 
	This is our idea of a prankTM on people who don't read README files, because we're monsters.

[!*!] HOWEVER... 
[***] if you add the correct incantations, it will enable the aforementioned 
	  L.A.I.M. and the file paths where candy may be found will fall out.



# Snaffler Usage
@The key incantations are:

-o	Enables outputting results to a file. 
	You probably want this if you're not using -s. 
	
	e.g. -o C:\users\thing\snaffler.log


-s	Enables outputting results to stdout as soon as they're found. 
	You probably want this if you're not using -o.


-v	Controls verbosity level, options are:
	- Trace (most verbose), 
	- Debug (less verbose), 
	- Info (less verbose still, default), and 
	- Data (results only). e.g -v debug


-m	Enables and assigns an output dir for snaffler to automatically take a copy of 
	(or Snaffle... if you will) any found files that it likes.


-l	Maximum size of files (in bytes) to Snaffle. 
	Defaults to 10000000, which is about 10MB.


-i	Disables computer and share discovery, 
	! requires a path to a directory in which to perform file discovery.


-d	Domain to search for computers to search for shares on to search for files in. 
	Easy.


-c	Domain controller to query for the list of domain computers.


-r	The maximum size file (in bytes) to search inside for interesting strings. 
	Defaults to 500k.


-j	How many bytes of context either side of found strings in files to show, 
	e.g. -j 200


-z Path to a config file that defines all of the above, and much much more! 
	See below for more details. 
	
	Give it -z generate to generate a sample config file called .\default.toml.
