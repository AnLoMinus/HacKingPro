FLAN
******

Flan Scan is a lightweight network vulnerability scanner. With Flan Scan you can easily find open ports on your network, identify services and their version, and get a list of relevant CVEs affecting your network.

Flan Scan is a wrapper over Nmap and the vulners script which turns Nmap into a full-fledged network vulnerability scanner. Flan Scan makes it easy to deploy Nmap locally within a container, push results to the cloud, and deploy the scanner on Kubernetes.
