Seeker
*******
Concept behind Seeker is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your location like many popular location based websites. Read more on thewhiteh4t's Blog .Seeker Hosts a fake website on In Built PHP Server and uses Serveo to generate a link which we will forward to the target, website asks for Location Permission and if the target allows it, we can get :

	Longitude
	Latitude
	Accuracy
	Altitude - Not always available
	Direction - Only available if user is moving
	Speed - Only available if user is moving
	Along with Location Information we also get Device Information without any permissions :

Operating System
Platform
Number of CPU Cores
Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
Screen Resolution
GPU information
Browser Name and Version
Public IP Address
IP Address Reconnaissance

This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.

How is this Different from IP GeoLocation
Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is NOT accurate at all and does not give location of the target instead it is the approximate location of the ISP.

Seeker uses HTML API and gets Location Permission and then grabs Longitude and Latitude using GPS Hardware which is present in the device, so Seeker works best with Smartphones, if the GPS Hardware is not present, such as on a Laptop, Seeker fallbacks to IP Geolocation or it will look for Cached Coordinates.

Generally if a user accepts location permsission, Accuracy of the information recieved is accurate to approximately 30 meters, Accuracy Depends on the Device.

Note : On iPhone due to some reason location accuracy is approximately 65 meters.
