  > Overview Sifter is a fully stocked Op Centre for Pentesters. Made up of over 80 different tools. It combines a plethara of OSINT, recon and vulnerability analysis tools within catagorized modsets in order to quickly perform recon tasks, check network firewalling, enumerate remote and local hosts, and scan for the 'blue' vulnerabilities within microsoft and if unpatched, exploit them. It uses tools like blackwidow and konan for webdir enumeration and attack surface mapping rapidly using ASM.
Gathered info is saved to the results folder, these output files can be easily parsed over to [TigerShark](https://github.com/s1l3nt78/TigerShark) in order to be utilised within your campaign. Or compiled for a final report to wrap up a penetration test.
