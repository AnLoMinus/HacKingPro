# Snaffler

[!] What is it for?
[*] Snaffler is a tool for pentesters to help find delicious 
	candy needles (creds mostly, but it's flexible) in a bunch 
	of horrible boring haystacks (a massive Windows/AD environment).

	It might also be useful for other people doing other stuff, 
	but it is explicitly NOT meant to be an "audit" tool.

[!] # Example Usage:

	> snaffler.exe -s -o snaffler.log


[!] What does it do?
[*] It gets a list of Windows computers from Active Directory, 
	then spreads out its snaffly appendages to them all to figure 
	out which ones have file shares, and whether you can read them.

	Then YET MORE snaffly appendages enumerate all the files in those 
	shares and use LEARNED ARTIFACTUAL INTELLIGENCE for MACHINES to 
	figure out which ones a grubby little hacker like you might want.


[!][!] Actually it doesn't do any ML stuff (yet)! 
[*]	because doing that right would require training data, and that 
	would require an enormous amount of time that we don't have.


# How do I use it?

[!] If you "literally just run the EXE on a domain joined machine in the context 
	of a domain user" (as people were instructed to do with Grouper2, immediately 
	before they ran it with all the verbose/debug switches on so it screamed several 
	hundred megabytes of stack traces at them) it will basically do nothing. 
	This is our idea of a prankTM on people who don't read README files, because we're monsters.

[!*!] HOWEVER... 
[***] if you add the correct incantations, it will enable the aforementioned 
	  L.A.I.M. and the file paths where candy may be found will fall out.
