WBRUTER
^^^^^^^^

! README

	wbruter is is the first tool wich has been released as open source wich
	can guarantee 100% that your pin code will be cracked aslong as usb debugging 
	has been enable. wbruter also includes some other brute methods like dictionary
	attacks for gmail, ftp, rar, zip and some other file extensions.

	wbruter will allways try to bring support for rare protocols, wbruter wont contain 
	common stuff like other brute tools cover like facebook, snapchat, instagram and
	you name it (except a few exceptions, very few)


! Many times it's the easiest methods that are the most powerful methods, 
	it's just a matter of using your imagination ;-)


! INFO: 2020-07-11:

	Android and Google, now have set a rule for locksettings via cli 
	as via gui earlier, if you try to many attempts within X seconds 
	you will be blocked for X seconds so wbruter via cli wont work 
	anymore on devices that has been upgraded to latest version Android 
	10, older version should work fine unless they are upgraded to latest android version.


! Enable USB-Debugging via the methods below:
	Via GUI:
		Go to settings -> about > press on build number 7 times and the 
		developer settings will be enable, go back to settings and press 
		on developer mode and then enable USB DEBUGGING. If you found an 
		android deviceon the street or something and want to break the pin 
		this wont be possible unless you already know the pin so the device 
		must have usb debugging enable for this to work. You wanna try this 
		for fun then you can just enable usb debugging after you unlocked phone)


! Via cli/adb:
	settings put global development_settings_enabled 1
	setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1
