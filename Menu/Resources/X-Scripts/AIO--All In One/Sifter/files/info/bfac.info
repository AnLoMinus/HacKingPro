BFAC

	Advanced Backup-File Artifacts Testing for Web-Applications

BFAC (Backup File Artifacts Checker) is an automated tool that checks for backup artifacts that may disclose the web-application's source code. The artifacts can also lead to leakage of sensitive information, such as passwords, directory structure, etc.

The goal of BFAC is to be an all-in-one tool for backup-file artifacts black-box testing.
