!What is this?

theHarvester is a very simple to use, yet powerful and effective tool designed to be used in the early stages of a
penetration test or red team engagement. Use it for open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine a
company's external threat landscape on the internet. The tool gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs and URLs using
