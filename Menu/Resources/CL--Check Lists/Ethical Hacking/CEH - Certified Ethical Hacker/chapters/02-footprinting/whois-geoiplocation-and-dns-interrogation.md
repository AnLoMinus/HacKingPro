# WHOIS, GeoIpLocation and DNS interrogation

- All public records, accessing is not illegal.

## WHOIS

- Query and response protocol (port 43)
- Used for retrieving information about assigned Internet resources
- To get WHOIS information you can
  - Use different websites such as [whois.net](https://www.whois.net)
  - Use command-line: `whois cloudarchitecture.io`
- Two models
  - **Thick WHOIS**: information from all registrars for the specified set of data.
  - **Thin WHOIS**: limited information about the specified set of data.

### WHOIS results

- Domain details
- üìù Domain owner details
  - Includes contact information of the owner
  - Can be hidden by a **WHOIS guard**
    - A proxy between the owner of the domain and who's accessing
    - Emails are usually still redirected to the owner.
      - üí° Allows for e-mail phishing to learn who the actual owner is.
- Domain server
  - Who it's registered with e.g. [NameCheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com), [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net)
  - üí° Site owner might have account in the server, and you can test passwords there.
- Net range
- Domain expiration
  - üí° If auto-renewal fails, someone can transfer a domain to another address for malicious behaviors or just to sell it back to you.
- Creation and last update dates

### Regional internet registries

- WHOIS databases are maintained by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) such as:
  - **ARIN**: American Registry for Internet Numbers
  - **AFRINIC**: African Network Information Center
  - **APNIC**: Asia Pacific Network Information Center
  - **RIPE**: R√©seaux IP Europ√©ens Network Coordination Centre
  - **LACNIC**: Latin American and Caribbean Network Information Center
- ü§ó Every ISP, hosting company etc. must be member of one of the registries to get IP addresses.

## IP geolocation

- Helps find location information about a target
- Includes country, city, postal code, ISP, and so on
  - Country is mostly accurate but city, coordinates are not but approximated
- Helps with social engineering attacks
- E.g. [GeoIpTool.com](https://geoiptool.com)

### DNS interrogation

- Collecting information about DNS zone data.
  - e.g. server types and their locations
- Includes information about key hosts in the network
- üìù E.g. `host -t a cloudarchitecture.com`
  - `t` stands for type of domain record `a` gives A type of domain records.
  - Returns something likes this:

    ```txt
        cloudarchitecture.io has address 13.33.17.159
        cloudarchitecture.io has address 13.33.17.136
    ```

  - A records returns multiple IP addresses to increase speed and availability e.g. when hosting same content in multiple continents.
- See also [DNS enumeration](./../04-enumeration/dns-enumeration.md#dns-records)

#### Reverse DNS lookup

- Use one of IP addresses that's listed as an A
- `host 13.33.17.159`
  - Returns `159.17.33.13.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer server-13-33-17-159.arn53.r.cloudfront.net.`
- Multiple IP addresses can be tied to same domain
  - multiple domain addresses that are tied to the same IP

#### MX records

- Can be retrieved with `-t mx`
- Exposes which e-mail service they use
- Have a preference number to tell the SMTP client to try (and retry) each of the relevant addresses in the list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds
  - The smallest preference number has the highest priority
- üí° Once a hacker know who the e-mail provider is, he/she can create fake-mails using the provider to test e.g.
  - What kind of content is allowed
  - If a file be modified so it appears as PDF but make it executable
  - When an e-mail is labeled as spam / malicious
