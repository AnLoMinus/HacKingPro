# Tunneling protocols

- Allows for the movement of data from one network to another
- Involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, usually using encryption
  - Can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel.

## OpenVPN

- [Open-source](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn) [VPN](./../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/firewall-overview.md#virtual-private-network-vpn) system
- Create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities
- Allows peers to authenticate each other using
  - pre-shared secret keys
  - [certificates](encrypting-communication.md#digital-certificate)
  - or username/password

## SSH (Secure Shell)

- Cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
- Usually used for remote command-line, login, and remote command execution.
- Replaces insecure [Telnet](./../03-scanning-networks/banner-grabbing.md#telnet)
- Introduces **SSH file transfer (SFTP)** or **secure copy (SCP)** protocols for secure file access,transfer and management.
- **SSH handshake**
  1. [TCP three-way handshake](./../03-scanning-networks/tcpip-basics.md#three-way-handshake)
  2. Protocol/software version announcement
  3. Algorithm negotiation
  4. Key exchange using [Elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman](encryption-algorithms.md#elliptic-curve-diffiehellman)

## IPSec

- IPsec is an end-to-end security scheme
- üìù Part of IPv4 suite so it runs on layer 3 (internet layer) in [TCP/IP model](./../03-scanning-networks/tcpip-basics.md#tcpip-model) or layer 3 (transport) in [OSI model](./../03-scanning-networks/tcpip-basics.md#osi-model)
- üìù Provides security through
  - **Authentication** through authenticating both parts
  - **Integrity** through using a hash algorithm to ensure that data is not tampered with.
  - **Non-repudiation** through using public key digital signatures to prove message origin.
  - **Confidentiality** through encryption

### IKE (Internet Key Exchange)

- Also known as **IKEv1** or **IKEv2** depending on the version.
- üìù Encrypts packets (payloads and headers) between parts
- Uses [X.509](./encrypting-communication.md#x509) for public key and encryption
- Cryptographic settings are established through ***Internet Key Exchange crypto profile*** (IKE policies)
- Tool: [`ike-scan`](https://github.com/royhills/ike-scan)
  - Discover, fingerprint and test IPsec VPN servers and firewalls
  - Sends a specially crafted IKE packet to each host within a network
- üìù Deployed widely to implement e.g.
  - virtual private networks (VPNs)
  - remote user access through dial up connection to private networks

### IPSec security architecture

- **Authentication Headers (AH)**
  - Provides connectionless integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet
  - Provides protection against replay attacks
- **Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP)**
  - üìù In addition to AH it provides confidentiality through encryption
  - Unlike AH, it does not provide integrity and authentication for entire IP packet
    - The outer header (including any outer IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers) remains unprotected
  - Supports encryption-only and (‚ùó insecure) authentication-only configurations
- **Security Associations (SA)**
  - Provides the bundle of algorithms and data to provide the parameters necessary for AH and/or ESP

### IPSec modes of operation

- AH and ESP can be implemented in both modes

#### Transport mode

- Usually authenticated
- Only payload is optionally encrypted.
- Not compatible with NAT when authenticated.
- üìù Used within same network

#### Tunnel mode

- Entire packet is encrypted and authenticated.
- Compatible with NAT
- üìù Used to create virtual private networks between different networks.

## PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

- Provide connection authentication, transmission encryption and compression.
- Provides router-to-router or host-to-network connections over asynchronous and synchronous circuits.
- Can be used to create e.g. SSH tunnels
- OSI Layer: 2 - Data link | Internet protocol suite layer: 1 - Link layer

### Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)

- Insecure/obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks
- Uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate PPP packets.
