# Information security controls overview

## Information Assurance (IA)

- Maintaining following of information during its use, storage, processing and transfer:
  - **Integrity**: No tampering of data from point A to point B, e.g. restraining physical access.
  - **Availability**: At all times data needs to be available to those who need it, e.g. stock market
  - **Confidentiality**: No leaks, e.g. ensuring policies are in-place
  - **Authenticity**: Only those who are authorized can access something
  - **Non-repudiation**: If you do something, you cannot say I did not do it, e.g. signatures, log files, camera videos.
- Processes to achieve information assurance are:
  - Security policies
  - Network and user authentication strategy
  - Identification of vulnerabilities and threats e.g. pen-testing
  - Identification of problems in the system and resource requirements
  - Plan design for the identified requirements
  - Certification and accreditation to find vulnerabilities and remove them
  - Training for employees

## Types of control

- By type
  - [**Physical controls**](./physical-security.md)
    - E.g. fences, doors, locks and fire extinguishers
  - **Technical controls**
    - Also known as ***logical controls***
    - E.g. security tokens
  - **Administrative controls**
    - E.g. security policies and continuity of operations plans are administrative control
- By function
  - **Preventative controls**
    - Prevents the threat from coming in contact with the weakness
    - E.g. authentication, encryption (such as [IPSec](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ipsec))
  - **Detective controls**
    - Used after a discretionary event.
    - E.g. audits, alarm bells, alerts
  - **Corrective controls**
    - Put in place after the detective internal controls discover a problem
    - E.g. backups and restore

## Information Security Management Program

- All activities the organization takes to protect sensitive information
- E.g. security policies, rules, standards, business resilience, training and awareness, security metrics and reporting.

## Enterprise Information Security Architecture (EISA)

- Regulates organizations structure and behavior in terms of security, processes and employees.
- Includes requirements, process, principles and models
- Goals:
  - Real time monitoring of organization's network
  - Security breach detection and recovery
  - Ensuring cost efficiency of security provisions
  - Helping the IT department to function properly
    - e.g. with policies and education
  - Risk assessment of IT assets

### Security management framework

- To reduce risks of any system
  - Risks are never zero but you should reduce as much as u can
- Combination of policies, procedures, guidelines and standards

## Defense in Depth

- Also known as **defence in depth**
- üìù Using multiple layers for protection
- Like a tower defence game
- Provides redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited
- Layers:
  1. **Policies, Procedures, Awareness**: Data Classification, Risk Management, Code Reviews, Educations...
  2. **Physical security**: ID cards, CCTV, fences...
     - Maintenance board should be protected in server room.
     - Not good in schools, universities etc.
  3. **Perimeter**: Encryption, identities...
     - In front of the internal network where traffic in and out is filtered.
  4. **Internal network**: Network zoning, firewalls...
  5. **Host**: Antivirus patches, security updates...
     - Individual devices with networking capability e.g. servers / PCs.
  6. **Services**: Audit logs, authentication, authorization, coding practices.
     - Applications running on hosts
  7. **Data**: Backups, encryption...
