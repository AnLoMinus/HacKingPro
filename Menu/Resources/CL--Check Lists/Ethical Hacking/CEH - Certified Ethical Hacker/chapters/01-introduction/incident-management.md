# Incident management

- üìù Process of identifying, prioritizing and solving security incidents.
- Goal: Restore the system back to normal, trigger alerts to prevent any potential risks.
- üìù Steps (flexible, not a strict rule):
  1. **Preparation for incident handling and response**
     - You know how you'll handle it when it happens.
     - Policies, trainings, tools, guidelines...
  2. **Detection and analysis**
     - Conduct in-depth analysis to what has happened: why, how, where, what
  3. **Categorization and prioritization**
  4. **Notification**
     - Notify proper people who are affected and who can act on it.
  5. **Containment**
     - Prevent the occurring incident from causing more damage.
     - E.g. put them in quarantine then we'll figure out what to do
  6. **Forensic investigation**
     - What happened, why?
  7. **Eradication**
     - Wipe the threat completely
  8. **Recovery**
     - Restore the system to working state
  9. **Post-incident activities** (lessons learnt)
     - Record what happened with final review.
     - Have discussion about how to avoid it in future.
- ü§ó E.g. a developer in [Dropbox miscoded](https://www.cnet.com/news/dropbox-confirms-security-glitch-no-password-required/) authentication function to always return true.
  - Anyone could login as whichever you user you want by just typing their e-mail.
  - They had review policy but no one paid attention.
  - They had protocols against major breach.
  - Realized that it was critical and then they brought down the service to prevent huge damage (containment)
  - Conducted investigation to see what has happened and started recovery process
  - It was recorded and documented for current and future employees

## Emergency response plan

- Help companies address various emergency situations that could occur within their organization.
- Should include who to contact, how to act in an emergency, how to mitigate risk and what resources to use to minimize loss

## Security incident and event management (SIEM)

- Real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.
- Helps [SOC](#security-operations-center-soc) to perform its functions
- üìù Combines SIM and SEM
  - **SIM (Security information management)**
    - Long-term storage as well as analysis and reporting of log data.
  - **SEM (Security event manager)**
    - Real-time monitoring
    - Correlation of events
    - Notifications and console views.
- E.g. [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) is the most popular SIEM.

### SIEM use-cases

- Anomaly detection could help detect zero-days, misconfigurations, cyberwarfare
- Automatic parsing, log normalization and categorization
- Visualization to help with pattern detection
- Detection of covert, malicious communications and encrypted channels.

### SIEM components

- **Aggregation**: Combining different log data
- **Correlation**: Using e.g. AI to bundle events with common attributes
- **Alerting**: Automated analysis of correlated events
- **Dashboards**: Helps to see anomalies
- **Compliance**: Can gather compliance data to produce reports that adopt to existing processes
- **Retention**: Critical in forensic investigations as network breach is high likely discovered after it happens.
- **Forensic analysis**: The ability to search across logs on different nodes and time periods based on specific criteria.

## Security teams

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

- Centralized function within an organization
- Continuously monitors and improves an organization's security posture
- Prevents, detects, analyzes, and responds to cybersecurity incidents.
- Uses [SIEM](#security-incident-and-event-management-siem) tool to perform its function

### Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)

- Also known as ***CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)*** or ***Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)***
- Focuses on effective and quick incident response.
- Develops and refines the incident response plan.
- Typically receive threat intelligence from the [SOC](#security-operations-center-soc)
- üí° SIRT should first check effort and potential impact of the incident when begin investigation and response process.
- There are also national CERT teams such as [US-CERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Computer_Emergency_Readiness_Team) in USA, [CERT-SE](https://www.cert.se/) in Sweden and [TR-CERT](https://www.usom.gov.tr/) in Turkey.

### User Behavior Analytics (UBA)

- Monitoring user behavior in attempt to discover potential threats and attacks.
- When patterns are observed and normal is established, an admin can take a look at deviations.
- E.g. monitoring employee behavior against insider threats
- E.g. login attempts based on the location, monitoring access to privileged accounts.
