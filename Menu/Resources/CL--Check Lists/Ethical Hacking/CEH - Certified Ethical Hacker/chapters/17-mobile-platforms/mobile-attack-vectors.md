- Device
  - Phishing
- Network
- Data-center/cloud

### [OWASP Top 10 Mobile Threats](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/)

1. **[Improper Platform Usage](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m1-improper-platform-usage)**
   - Misuse of a platform feature or failure to use a platform security controls
   - Caused by insecure coding towards an exposed API
   - E.g. ‚Ä¢¬†Android intents ‚Ä¢ platform permissions ‚Ä¢ cloud risks ‚Ä¢ TouchID misuse ‚Ä¢ Keychain
   - Allows feeding malicious inputs or unexpected sequences of events to the vulnerable endpoint
2. **[Insecure Data Storage](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m2-insecure-data-storage)**
   - Caused by assumption that users/malware will not have access to a mobile device's filesystem.
   - Filesystem are easily accessible through computer connection and specialized tools.
   - üí° Use strong encryption
   - üí° Careful when logging, caching, storing data, sending analytics, setting cookies, etc.
3. **[Insecure Communication](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m3-insecure-communication)**
   - Allows exploiting vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data in transit
   - Communications include TCP/IP, WiFi, Bluetooth/Bluetooth-LE, NFC, audio, infrared, GSM, 3G, SMS...
   - Attacks include e.g. compromising local network in coffee shop, carrier/network devices or installing malware
   - Caused by e.g. ‚Ä¢ poor handshaking (with weak encryption) ‚Ä¢ not using SSL/TLS ‚Ä¢ lack of certificate ‚Ä¢ weak negotiation ‚Ä¢ cleartext communication of sensitive assets.
4. **[Insecure Authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m4-insecure-authentication)**
   - Captures notions of authenticating the end user or bad session management
   - Usually attacked through automated tools
   - Caused by poor or missing authentication schemes
   - Typically done via mobile malware within the device or botnets owned by the attacker.
   - üí° Use access tokens, never store keys locally, store data encrypted, do not use TouchID or 4-digit pins (even hashes can be cracked with rainbow tables easily), always authenticate on back-end
5. **[Insufficient Cryptography](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m4-insecure-authentication)**
   - Cryptography was attempted, but it wasn't done correctly
   - Can be caused by weak algorithms, poor key management processes
   - Creation and Use of Custom Encryption Protocols
   - üí° Do not trust code encryption from underlying OS ü§ó e.g. in iOS
     - Apps are encrypted and signed by trustworthy sources
     - iOS app loader will decrypt the app in memory execute after signature validation
     - Attacker can use jailbroken device and take snapshot of application memory once it's decrypted
6. **[Insecure Authorization](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m6-insecure-authorization)**
   - Allowed by poor or missing authorization schemes
   - Usually attacked through automated tools
   - Typically done via mobile malware within the device or botnets owned by the attacker.
   - Attacks include
     - binary attacks when application is in offline mode
     - using low-privilige session to gain more access by manipulating GET/POST request
   - Weaknesses include
     - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) i.e. endpoints without authorization checks.
     - Hidden endpoints as developers assume they'll not be seen by anyone
     - User role or permission transmissions from app to back-end
   - üí° Always verify claims/roles in back-end independently from client.
7. **[Client Code Quality](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m7-client-code-quality)**
   - All of the code-level implementation problem in the mobile client
   - Caused by passing untrusted inputs to method calls
   - Covers security decisions via untrusted inputs
   - May lead to
     - memory leaks and buffer overflows through app on the mobile device
     - foreign code execution or denial of service on remote server endpoints
8. **[Code Tampering](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m8-code-tampering)**
   - Usually done through changing forms of the apps to collect data
   - Attacker can directly modify the code, change the contents of memory dynamically, change or replace the system APIs that the application uses, or modify the application's data and resources
   - Malicious apps are typically distributed in third party stores
   - Phishing attacks can be used to trick users to install the apps.
   - E.g. ‚Ä¢ binary patching ‚Ä¢ local resource modification ‚Ä¢ method hooking ‚Ä¢¬†dynamic memory modification
   - üí° Countermeasures
     - Integrity checks during run-time.
     - Do not run if the device is rooted/jailbroken.
9. **[Reverse Engineering](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m9-reverse-engineering)**
   - Analysis of the final core binary to determine the source code, libraries, ...
10. **[Extraneous Functionality](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/2016-risks/m10-extraneous-functionality)**
    - Attacker analyzes the apps for test-code left behind, hidden functionality, switches etc.
    - Attacked to learn about back-end systems or running unauthorized high-privileged actions

#### Basic Threats

- Malware / rootkit
- Data Loss
- Data Tampering
- Data Exfiltration

#### Vulnerabilities And Risks on Mobile Platforms

- Malicious third-party application / in the store
- Application vulnerability
- Data security
- Excessive permissions
- Weak encryptions
- Operating System update issue
- Application update issue
- Jailbreaking / rooting
- Physical attack

#### OS Sandboxing Issue

- Sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs, usually in an effort to mitigate system failures or software
vulnerabilities from spreading
- Sandbox limits the app's access to files, preferences, network resources, ...
- Advanced malware designed to bypass it, by fragment code or put sleep timer in the script to bypass the inspection process

## Android

### Device Administration API

- Provides device administration features at the system level
- This API allows to create security-aware apps that are useful in the enterprise settings, where require rich control over employee devices

### Rooting

- A process of allowing user to attain privileged control
- Needed for modify settings, get full control over the kernel or install custom ROMs
- E.g. [SuperOneClick](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/superoneclick/) allows to root Android phones.

## iOS

### Jailbreaking

- Rooting the iOS
- Escalating the privileges on iOS to remove or bypass the factory default restrictions

#### Jailbreaking exploits

- **Userland exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level access without escalating iBoot-level access
- **iBoot exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level and boot-level access
- **BootROM exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level and boot-level access

#### Jailbreaking Techniques

##### Untethered jailbreak

- Does not require to reboot with a connection to your computer
- Exploit bypass the iBoot sequence

##### Tethered jailbreak

- Need a connection to your computer to reboot, without it, the boot stuck with an Apple logo
- Offers complete jailbreak features

##### Semi-Untethered jailbreak

- Allows to boot into the iOS device, but with limited functionality
- The jailbreak functions will be disabled until the launch of a jailbreak app

#### Semi-Tethered jailbreak

- Allows you to boot with limited functionality
- To get the full functionality, a reboot with a tethered jailbreak required
- Tethered jailbreak + a package to allow reboot with limited functionality
- ‚ùó A reboot no longer retains the patched kernel
  - But the installed jailbreaking tool can be used if admin privileges are required.

## Windows Phone

- Windows Phone 8 using the Windows NT Kernel
- Windows Phone 8 include app sandboxing, remote device management, native code support (C++)

## BlackBerry OS

- Support for Java Micro Edition MIDP 1.0 and MIDP 2.0
- OS update with BlackBerry over the air software loading service (OTASL)

## Mobile Device Management (MDM)

- Deployment, maintenance and monitoring of mobile devices

### MDM Functions

- Enforce device to be locked after certain failed login
- Enforce strong password policy for all BYOD.
- MDM can detect attempt of hacking BYOD device and then limit the network access of the affected device
- Enforce confidentiality by using encryption as per organization's policy
- Administration and implementation of Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

### MDM Deployment Methods

#### On-site MDM Deployment

- Install MDM application on local servers
- Management is done by local staff
- Provide full control over the MDM

#### Cloud-based MDM Deployment

- MDM application is installed and maintained by a third party
- Less administration needed
- The deployment and maintenance is the responsibility of the service provider

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

BYOD is a trend of employees using their personal devices for work. It could be a laptop, a phone, etc...

#### BYOD Policies

BYOD policies should include:

- Device: which devices and operating systems are supported
- Password: require all devices to be password protected
- Access: determine which data can be accessed from employee's device
- Application: which applications allowed, which should be banned

## Mobile security guidelines

- Avoid auto-upload of files
- Perform security assessment of applications
- Turn off Bluetooth
- Allow only necessary GPS-enabled applications
- Do not connect to open network
- Install applications from trusted sources
- Use strong password
- Use [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](#mobile-device-management-mdm) softwares
- Update operating system often
- Do not allow rooting / jailbreaking
- Encrypt phone storage
- Periodic backup
- Configure mobile device policies
