## Layers of Control Implementation:

- [x] `Detect` – Determine the attempts to penetrate an organization.
- [x] `Deny` – Stopping the attacks when they are happening.
- [x] `Disrupt` – Intervene is the data communication done by the attacker and stops it then.
- [x] `Degrade` – This is to limit the effectiveness of a cybersecurity attack to minimize its ill effects.
- [x] `Deceive` – Mislead the attacker by providing them with misinformation or misdirecting them.
- [x] `Contain` – Contain and limit the scope of the attack so that it is restricted to only some part of the organization.
