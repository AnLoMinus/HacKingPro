    - ## [Legion](https://github.com/carlospolop/legion): Automatic Enumeration Tool based in Open Source tools
      > Legion is based in the Pentesting Methodology that you can find in book.hacktricks.xyz. <br> Legion is a tool that uses several well-known opensource tools to automatically, semi-automatically or manually enumerate the most frequent found services running in machines that you could need to pentest. <br> Basically, the goal of Legion is to extract all the information that you can from each opened network service, so you don't have to write and execute the same commands in a terminal every time you find that service. <br> Some actions are repeated by more than one tool, this is done to be sure that all the possible information is correctly extracted.

    - ## [Recon-X](https://github.com/Yashvendra/Recon-X): Advanced Reconnaissance tool to enumerate attacking surface of the target.
      > Recon-X is the ultimate tool to conveniently carry out the reconnaissance of your target and discover its attacking surface. <br> The tool itself comes with two options for installation. <br> First is the API mode, that is based on hackertarget API making it light and efficient and can be used for the identification of potential vulnerabilities. <br> However, the API is the free one so the scans are limited to 100 calls per day per IP. So either you can use proxy to change your public IP after API counter exceedes, or you can go with the second mode of this tool, which uses the best OSINT tools available on github, making this a beast for doing reconnaissance.
