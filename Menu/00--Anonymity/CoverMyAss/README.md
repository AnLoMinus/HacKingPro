### About

Shell script to cover your tracks on UNIX systems. Designed for pen testing "covering tracks" phase, before exiting the infected server. Or, permanently disable system logs for post-exploitation.

This tool allows you to clear log files such as :

```bash
# Linux
/var/log/messages # General message and system related stuff
/var/log/auth.log # Authenication logs
/var/log/kern.log # Kernel logs
/var/log/cron.log # Crond logs
/var/log/maillog # Mail server logs
/var/log/boot.log # System boot log
/var/log/mysqld.log # MySQL database server log file
/var/log/qmail # Qmail log directory
/var/log/httpd # Apache access and error logs directory
/var/log/lighttpd # Lighttpd access and error logs directory
/var/log/secure # Authentication log
/var/log/utmp # Login records file
/var/log/wtmp # Login records file
/var/log/yum.log # Yum command log file

# macOS
/var/log/system.log # System Log
/var/log/DiagnosticMessages # Mac Analytics Data
/Library/Logs # System Application Logs
/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports # System Reports
~/Library/Logs # User Application Logs
~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports # User Reports
```

## Installation

With sudo

```bash
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundowndev/covermyass/master/covermyass -o /usr/bin/covermyass
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/covermyass
```

Without sudo :

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sundowndev/covermyass/master/covermyass -o ~/.local/bin/covermyass
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/covermyass
```

You can now use the tool using the executable.

Keep in mind that without sudo privileges, you *might* be unable to clear system-level log files (`/var/log`).

## Usage

Simply type :

```
covermyass # you may need to use sudo if you want to clean auth logs
```

Follow the instructions :

```
Welcome to Cover my ass tool !

Select an option :

1) Clear logs for user root
2) Permenently disable auth & bash history
3) Restore settings to default
99) Exit tool

>
```

*NOTE: don't forget to exit the terminal session since the bash history is cached.*

Clear logs instantly (requires *sudo* to be efficient) :

```
sudo covermyass now
```

### Using cron job

Clear bash history every day at 5am :

```bash
0 5 * * * covermyass now >/dev/null 2>&1
```
