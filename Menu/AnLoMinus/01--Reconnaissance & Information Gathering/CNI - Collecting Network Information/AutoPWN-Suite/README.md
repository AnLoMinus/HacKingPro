## Features
- Fully automatic! (Use `-y` flag to enable)
- Detect network IP range without any user input. 
- Vulnerability detection based on version.
- Web app vulnerability testing. (Only LFI for now)
- Get information about the vulnerability right from your terminal.
- Automatically download exploit related with vulnerability.
- Noise mode for creating a noise on the network.
- Evasion mode for being sneaky.
- Automatically decide which scan types to use based on privilege.
- Easy to read output.
- Specify your arguments using a config file.
- Send scan results via webhook or email.
- Works on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## How does it work?

AutoPWN Suite uses nmap TCP-SYN scan to enumerate the host and detect the version of softwares running on it. After gathering enough information about the host, AutoPWN Suite automatically generates a list of "keywords" to search [NIST vulnerability database](https://www.nist.gov/).

## Demo

AutoPWN Suite has a very user friendly easy to read output.
