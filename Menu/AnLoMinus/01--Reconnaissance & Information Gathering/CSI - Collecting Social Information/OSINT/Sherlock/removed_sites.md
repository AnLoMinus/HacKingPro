# List Of Sites Removed From Sherlock

This is a list of sites implemented in such a way that the current design of
Sherlock is not capable of determining if a given username exists or not.
They are listed here in the hope that things may change in the future
so they may be re-included.


## gpodder.net

As of 2020-05-25, all usernames are reported as available.

The server is returning a HTTP Status 500 (Internal server error)
for all queries.

```
  "gpodder.net": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 2013984,
    "url": "https://gpodder.net/user/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://gpodder.net/",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```


## Investing.com

As of 2020-05-25, all usernames are reported as claimed.

Any query against a user seems to be redirecting to a general
information page at https://www.investing.com/brokers/.  Probably
required login before access.

```
  "Investing.com": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 196,
    "url": "https://www.investing.com/traders/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://www.investing.com/",
    "username_claimed": "jenny",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## AdobeForums

As of 2020-04-12, all usernames are reported as available.

When I went to the site to see what was going on, usernames that I know
existed were redirecting to the main page.

I was able to see user profiles without logging in, but the URL was not
related to their user name.  For example, user "tomke" went to
https://community.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10882613.
This can be detected, but it requires a different detection method.

```
  "AdobeForums": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 59,
    "url": "https://forums.adobe.com/people/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://forums.adobe.com/",

  },
```

```

    "url": "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://www.khanacademy.org/",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```


## EVE Online

Usernames that exist are not detected.

```
  "EVE Online": {
    "errorType": "response_url",
    "errorUrl": "https://eveonline.com",
    "rank": 15347,
    "url": "https://evewho.com/pilot/{}/",
    "urlMain": "https://eveonline.com",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## AngelList

Usernames that exist are not detected. Forbidden Request 403 Error.

```
  "AngelList": {

    "url": "https://angel.co/u/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://angel.co/",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## PowerShell Gallery

Accidentally merged even though the original pull request showed that all
user names were available.

```
  "PowerShell Gallery": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 163562,
    "url": "https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://www.powershellgallery.com",
    "username_claimed": "powershellteam",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## LinkedIn

This was attempted to be added around 2019-08-26, but the pull request was never merged.
It turns out that LinkedIn requires that you have an account before they will let you
check for other account.  So, this site will not work with the current design of
Sherlock.

## StreamMe

On 2019-04-07, I get a Timed Out message from the website.  It has not
been working earlier either (for some weeks).  It takes about 21s before
the site finally times out, so it really makes getting the results from
Sherlock a pain.

If the site becomes available in the future, we can put it back in.

```
  "StreamMe": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 31702,
    "url": "https://www.stream.me/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://www.stream.me/",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## BlackPlanet

This site has always returned a false positive.  The site returns the exact
same text for a claimed or an unclaimed username.  The site must be rendering
all of the different content using Javascript in the browser.  So, there is
no way distinguish between the results with the current design of Sherlock.

```
  "BlackPlanet": {
    "errorMsg": "My Hits",
    "errorType": "message",
    "rank": 110021,
    "url": "http://blackplanet.com/{}",
    "urlMain": "http://blackplanet.com/"
  },
```

## Fotolog

Around 2019-02-09, I get a 502 HTTP error (bad gateway) for any access.  On
2019-03-10, the site is up, but it is in maintenance mode.

It does not seem to be working, so there is no sense in including it in
Sherlock.

```
  "Fotolog": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 47777,
    "url": "https://fotolog.com/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://fotolog.com/"
  },
```

## Google Plus

On 2019-04-02, Google shutdown Google Plus.  While the content for some
users is available after that point, it is going away.  And, no one will
be able to create a new account.  So, there is no value is keeping it in
Sherlock.

Good-bye [Google Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B)...

```
  "Google Plus": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 1,
    "url": "https://plus.google.com/+{}",
    "urlMain": "https://plus.google.com/",
    "username_claimed": "davidbrin1",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```


## Furaffinity

As of 2020-02-23, Furaffinity returns false postives because they are now using Cloudflair, which prevents Sherlock from checking if the user
exists or not.

```
  "furaffinity": {
    "errorMsg": "user cannot be found",
    "errorType": "message",
    "rank": 0,
    "url": "https://www.furaffinity.net/user/{}",
    "urlMain": "https://www.furaffinity.net",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis777777"
  },
```


## InsaneJournal

As of 2020-02-23, InsaneJournal returns false positive, when providing a username which contains a period.
Since we were not able to find the critera for a valid username, the best thing to do now is to remove it.

```
  "InsaneJournal": {
    "errorMsg": "Unknown user",
    "errorType": "message",
    "rank": 29728,
    "url": "http://{}.insanejournal.com/profile",
    "urlMain": "insanejournal.com",
    "username_claimed": "blue",
    "username_unclaimed": "dlyr6cd"
  },
```

## Sports Tracker

As of 2020-04-02, Sports Tracker returns false positives. Checking with `errorMsg` and `response_url`
did not seem to work.

```
   "SportsTracker": {
     "errorUrl": "https://www.sports-tracker.com/page-not-found",
     "errorType": "response_url",
     "rank": 93950,

     "urlMain": "https://www.sports-tracker.com/",
     "username_claimed": "blue",
     "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeveruse"
   },
```

## Trip

As of 2020-04-02, Trip by Skyscanner seems to not work beceause it keeps on
redirecting to skyscanner.com whether the username exists or not.

```
  "Trip": {
      "errorType": "status_code",
      "rank": 2847,
      "url": "https://www.trip.skyscanner.com/user/{}",
      "urlMain": "https://www.trip.skyscanner.com/",
      "username_claimed": "blue",
      "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },

```

## boingboing.net

As of 2020-04-02, boingboing.net requires a login to check if a user exits or not.

     "rank": 5821,
     "url": "https://bbs.boingboing.net/u/{}",

     "username_claimed": "admin",
     "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
   },
```

## elwoRU
As of 2020-04-04, elwoRu does not exist anymore. I confirmed using
downforeveryoneorjustme.com that the website is down.

    "urlMain": "https://elwo.ru/",
    "username_claimed": "red",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## ingvarr.net.ru

As of 2020-04-04, ingvarr.net.ru does not exist anymore. I confirmed using
downforeveryoneorjustme.com that the website is down.

```
  "ingvarr.net.ru": {

    "username_claimed": "red",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## Redsun.tf

As of 2020-06-20, Redsun.tf seems to be adding random digits to the end of the usernames which makes it pretty much impossible
for Sherlock to check for usernames on this particular website.

```
  "Redsun.tf": {
    "errorMsg": "The specified member cannot be found",
    "errorType": "message",
    "rank": 3796657,

    "urlMain": "https://redsun.tf/",
    "username_claimed": "dan",
    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis"
  },
```

## Creative Market

As of 2020-06-20, Creative Market has a captcha to prove that you are a human, and because of this
Sherlock is unable to check for username on this site because we will always get  a page which asks
us to prove that we are not a robot.

```
  "CreativeMarket": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 1896,
    "url": "https://creativemarket.com/users/{}",

    "username_unclaimed": "noonewouldeverusethis7"
  },
```

## pvpru

As of 2020-06-20, pvpru uses CloudFlair, and because of this we get a "Access denied" error whenever
we try to check for a username.

```
  "pvpru": {
    "errorType": "status_code",
    "rank": 405547,
