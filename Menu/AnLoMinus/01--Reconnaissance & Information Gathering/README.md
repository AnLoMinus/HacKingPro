> - ## **What are the objectives of information gathering in cybersecurity?**

> - ### Any basic cybersecurity information gathering process often includes these two types of data collection goals:

>   - [x] CAO - [`Collecting All in One`]():

>   - [x] CNI - [`Collecting Network Information`](): 
>       - Such as public, private and associated domain names, network hosts, public and private IP blocks, routing tables, TCP and UDP running services, SSL certificates, open ports and more.

>   - [x] CMI - [`Collecting Machine Information`]():  
>       - This includes user enumeration, system groups, OS hostnames, OS system type (probably by fingerprinting), system banners (as seen in the banner grabbing blog post), etc.

>   - [x] CSI - [`Collecting Social Information`]():

### [Squirt](https://github.com/CybernetiX-S3C/Squirt)
#### Squirt is an offensive information and vulnerability scanner.
#### Just supply a domain name to **Squirt** and it will automatically do the following for you:

* Check and Bypass Cloudflare
* Retrieve Server and Powered by Headers
* Fingerprint the operating system of Web Server
* Detect CMS (197+ CMSs are supported)
* Launch WPScan if target is using Wordpress
* Retrieve robots.txt
* Whois lookup
* Check if the target is a honeypot
* Port Scan with banner grabbing
* Dumps all kind of DNS records
* Generate a map for visualizing the attack surface
* Gather Emails related to the target
* Find websites hosted on the same web server
* Find hosts using google
* Crawl the website for URLs having parameters
* SQLi scan using online implemention of SQLMap (takes < 3 min.)
* Basic XSS scanning

#### Install and Run in Linux 
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CybernetiX-S3C/Squirt
    cd Squirt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python Squirt.py
  ```

# Information gathering techniques and methods
- Ethical hackers use a big variety of techniques and tools to get this precious information about their targets, as well as locations and data collection software theyâ€™ll be using towards the information gathering goal.
- Letâ€™s look at the top information gathering methods used to gather information about any target.
> - # How to gather information?

---

>   - ## 1 - [`Social Engineering`](): This includes in-person chat, phone conversations and email spoofing attacks. 
>        - What all these methods have in common is the psychology of human weakness, needed to get maximum data about the target.

---

>   - ## 2 - [`Search Engines`](): Web crawlers can be used to fetch information about anything, and this includes companies, persons, services, and even real hacks, as seen in our previous article about Google Hacking.

---

>   - ## 3 - [`Social Networks`](): Open Source Intelligence
>       - ### [`OSINT`]() ~ Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks are great sources of information to build a profile, especially when targeting individuals.

---

>   - ## 4 - [`Domain Names`](): These are registered by organizations, governments, public and private agencies, and people. 
>       - ### [`DNS`]() ~ Domain Name Server
>       - Therefore, theyâ€™re a great starting point when you want to investigate someone. 
>       - Personal information, associated domains, projects, services and technologies can be found by inspecting domain name information.

- All these techniques are really useful when combined with enterprise security tools. 
- Keep reading to discover how to maximize your information gathering results by using some really cool infosec utilities.
