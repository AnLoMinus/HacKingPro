Project Morya is just a collection of bash scripts that runs iteratively to carry out various tools and recon process & store output in an organized way. This Project was built to automate my recon process, and after working on this project for months, I thought to make Project Morya public.

Please feel free to improve it in any way you can. There is no secret involved, and it's just a set of commands and existing tools written in bash-scripts for simple Recon Automation.

Currently this tools supports performing recon for:
 
 1.  `Subdomain Enumeration:` <br>
      It just enumerate subdomain 
      
 2.  `Medium Level Scan:` <br>
      It scan's for [ subdomain Enumeration, subdomain Takeover, wayback_Urls, probing_Domains, nuclei_Scanning, port_Scanning ]
      
 3.  `Advance level Scan:` <br>
      It scan's for [ subdomain Enumeration, subdomain Takeover, wayback_Urls, probing_Domains, nuclei_Scanning, port_Scanning, dirsearch, xss scan ]

<summary> üëâ Using screen command üëà</summary><br>

> screen command in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session. When a process is started with ‚Äòscreen‚Äô, 
> the process can be detached from session & then can reattach the session at a later time. When the session is detached, the process that was originally 
> started from the screen is still running and managed by the screen itself. The process can then re-attach the session at a later time, and the terminals
> are still there, the way it was left

#### Steps to use screen command
 
* To list active screens
  - `screen -ls`
* Name this session 
  - `screen -S <name>`
* If you see detach then to this
 	- `screen -r <number/name>` 
 	
* If you see reattach then to this
 	- `screen -d <number/name>` =>		[ To detach your screen ]
 	- `screen -r <number/name>`	=> 	[ To reattach your screen ]
