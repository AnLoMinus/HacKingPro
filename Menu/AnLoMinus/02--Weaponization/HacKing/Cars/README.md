## OBDII Adapters

You will need an OBDII adapter to get started.  

Here are three of my favorites that I own and test with:

| Tool Name | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| USB ELM327 | <http://a.co/7YrtPui> | Best for getting started and virtual environments. |
| Veepeak Bluetooth | <http://a.co/80FLIMV> | Great for permanent installs and using with your phone. |
| Cantact | <https://hackerwarehouse.com/product/cantact-bundle/> | An amazing open-source project for advanced users. |
| $10 Veepeak Bluetooth | <http://a.co/ajFbcZ4> |  Great for getting started has some limitations. |
