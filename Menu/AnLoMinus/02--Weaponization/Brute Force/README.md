### [Predator](https://github.com/CybernetiX-S3C/predator)
  - Predator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack, Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks. 
  - I opted for a different approach in order to not create yet another brute-forcing tool and avoid repeating the same shortcomings. 
  - Predator is a multi-threaded tool written in Python, that strives to be more reliable and flexible than his fellow predecessors.
