# Introduction to Linux üêß

### Requirements 
* Ubuntu virtual machine (or any disto desktop general-purpose like Manjaro, Fedora etc) (1)
* Kali Linux virtual machine (2)


### Objectives
* Understand the basics of Linux systems
* Perform basic system and network tasks from CLI (command line interface)
* Learn about Kali Linux and pre-installed security tools


**Before jumpstart into Kali Linux tutorial, it is recommended to use a desktop general-purpose distro like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) or [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/download/) for learning the basics and get used to, also you can check the [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/) to find a good distro to start with.**
 
1. __**The first part**__ of this tutorial uses **Ubuntu** VM to explain the basics of Linux environment, basic commands and techniques.

2. __**The second part**__ is about **Kali Linux** itself, covering security tools using more advanced techniques.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** *Kali is a Linux distribution specifically geared towards professional penetration testers and security specialists, and given its unique nature, **it is NOT recommended to use as¬†a general-purpose Linux desktop for development, web design, gaming, etc.*** 

# Why Linux so Popular?

![linux](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/best-linux-distros.jpg)

- Linux Torvalds not only created Linux but also made it available to the world for free. He then invited others to work for the modification of Linux and keep their contributions free. This is the reason why Linux gained an enormous amount of audience among hard-core developers very quickly. Another reason for this amazing amount of popularity is that Linux is extremely popular and favorite operating system among hackers. The main reason is Linux source code is freely available because it is an open source operating system.

- Linux is appealing for the people who wanted to experiment with operating system principles and who needed a **great deal of control over their operating system.**

- **Linux is widely used to run the internet and in all 85% of all the servers are running Linux.** Streams have 1600 games on Linux now, including many mainstream titles.

- Linux is faster than windows and because Windows is a commercial operating system it costs a lot of money while Linux being an open source operating system is free.

- The Linux terminal is superior to use over Window‚Äôs command line for developers. You would find many libraries developed natively for Linux. Also according to many developers, Linux helps the, get things done easily.
Linux doesn‚Äôt encounter a large number of software updates, but you will also observe much faster software updates so that the problems you might be facing can be eliminated.

# Setting up üß∞
First things first, you should download and deploy two virtual machines: **Ubuntu Linux** and **Kali Linux**. 

The recommended configuration for Ubuntu VM is 2GB to 3GB RAM and at least 4GB of RAM to Kali. **To makes things easier you can leave the default configuration for both machines.**

- [Ubuntu official website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- [Kali Linux official website](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/#1572305786534-030ce714-cc3b)

**Note**: If you don't know how to setup your VMs you can check the [previous module on lab building](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/blob/master/0-Core-Knowledge/1-Lab-Building.md) or more specifically a tutorial on [how to setup Ubuntu VM](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-ubuntu-virtualbox/).

# Diving into Ubuntu

At this point you should be familiar with a basic operating system such as Windows and the various programs that are already available on the Windows operating system. Ubuntu is no different, this linux distro is a very straightforward, stable and easy to use OS for newcomers, after the installation you're ready to go and explore.

**Note**: This tutorial will teach you **how to operate Linux by command line** not the interface. Technically you can do some tasks by using the interface, but I encourange to do as much you can on CLI (command line interface) and this tutorial will guide through this. By this way you can have a granular control to handle the system.

* Fire up your Ubuntu VM and explore by yourself the interface, pre-installed applications and configurations.
![ubuntu2](https://techlatest.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ubuntu-20.04-app-folders-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg)

## UI vs. CLI
This example will compare the differences between UI(user interface) and CLI(command line interface) by performing a simple task: 
   - create a text file, write some words and save it.

This is just a simple example to grasp the idea behind command line. 

1. First, let's create a text file using the interface. Click on the 6 dotted button on the bottom right **(Show Applications)** and open the **Text Editor application**

![ub1](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/0490dd84d2611a7ed0631a21f851cc244f80ba4d/ub1.png)

2. Write **hello world** on the new file, and then save in your Desktop by giving the name **hello.txt**

![ub2](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/0490dd84d2611a7ed0631a21f851cc244f80ba4d/ub2.png)

3. Now, click again the 6 dotted button to show all applications and open a new **Terminal** window

4. To navigate to your desktop by using the terminal, type `cd Desktop`. Next type `echo hello world > hello2.txt`.
   - `cd` command means change directory. The next command will `echo` the string `hello world` and the symbol `>` tells the system to output results into a new file, the target is usually a filename (`hello2.txt`).

![ub3](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/0490dd84d2611a7ed0631a21f851cc244f80ba4d/ub3.png)

5. As you can see on the image below, the both methods perform the same results.

![ub4](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/0490dd84d2611a7ed0631a21f851cc244f80ba4d/ub4.png)


**Bottom line**, command line is the most powerful way to operate a Linux machine, you can leverage the granular control of Linux systems and do pretty much everything from command line in more robust, fast and efficient way. For example you can rename thousands of files with a simple one-liner command, instead of renaming one by one using UI. You can automate tasks, manage networks etc and do much more using the terminal.

# Linux structure
In Windows, the root begins at the drive letter, usually C:\, which basically means it begins at the hard drive. In Linux however, the root of the filesystem doesn‚Äôt correspond with a physical device or location, it‚Äôs a logical location of simply ‚Äú/‚Äù. See the graphics below for a visual representation.

To access the root of the filesystem, you can type `cd` to change directory following the destination `/` , representing the begining of the filesystem.
   - `cd /`

```
ubuntu@primary:/home$ cd /
Users  boot  etc   lib    lib64   lost+found  mnt  proc  run   snap  sys  usr
bin    dev   home  lib32  libx32  media       opt  root  sbin  srv   tmp  var
```

To understand the basics of each folder in the Linux file system is for, which will help us to better understand how Linux works in general. Note that not every folder listed here or pictured below necessarily appears in every Linux distro, but most of them do.

![structure](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/4d8d864d53230f3aa14495d486fd01274a54aec0/linux-structure.png)

# Core commands
The core commands will explore the most important user and system commands.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Remember that every command have a manual page, you can access on [this website](https://linux.die.net/man/) or directly from terminal by typing: `man <command>`

### `sudo` 
Sudo stands for SuperUser DO and is used to access restricted files and operations. By default, Linux restricts access to certain parts of the system preventing sensitive files from being compromised.

The sudo command temporarily elevates privileges allowing users to complete sensitive tasks without logging in as the root user.

1. **For example, lets try to update the Ubuntu packages without `sudo` command. To do that you can simple issue the `apt-get update` command and hit enter.**

```
purple@purple-vm:~$ apt-get update

Reading package lists... Done
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
W: Problem unlinking the file /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin - RemoveCaches (13: Permission denied)
W: Problem unlinking the file /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin - RemoveCaches (13: Permission denied)
```
As you can see above we got the **"13:  Permission denied" error**, meaning that we need root privileges to update Ubuntu packages.

2. **Next, issue the command with elevated privileges (root) using `sudo`. The command will be successfully executed.**

```
purple@purple-vm:~$ sudo apt-get update
[sudo] password for purple: 
Hit:1 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal InRelease
Hit:2 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-updates InRelease                     
Hit:3 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-backports InRelease                   
Hit:4 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable InRelease                 
Hit:5 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security InRelease                      
Reading package lists... Done
```

Also we have other `apt-get` variants:
   - `apt-get upgrade` ->  simply upgrades/installs the new version of the package available over the old one.
   - `apt-get dist-upgrade` -> This command looks for newer dependencies and prioritizes upgrading them by the possibility of removing the old ones ‚Äì which could be dangerous. Make sure to read the [official documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get) before issue this command.

3. **You also can switch to root user by using `su`. But is not recommended to operate as root as a security practice. Applications are meant to be run with non-administrative security, so you have to elevate their privileges to modify the underlying system.**

```
purple@purple-vm:~$ sudo su
[sudo] password for purple: 
root@purple-vm:/home/purple# 
```
As you can see, the user purple jumped to root user by using su.

### `pwd`
`pwd` stands for **P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory. It prints the path of the current directory that you are in, starting from the root.

```
purple@purple-vm:~$ pwd
/home/purple/work/code
```
## Linux Permissions 

Linux has three permissions and they can be set for the owner, group or other.

<p align="center">
<img width="90%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/01260d855800248f380bd6c2b58fe0425067cebf/linux-perms.png" />
</p>

> **r = read** - open a file, view a file.
> **w = write** - edit a file, add or delete files for directories.
> **x = execute** - run a file, execute a program or script, CD to a different directory.

Owner | Group | Other
:--:|:--:|:--:
rwx | rwx | rwx

* Viewing the permissions on Linux command-line:

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

### Using `chmod` 
`chmod` *is the command and system call which is used to change the access permissions of file system objects on Unix and Unix-like OS.*

* Clear out the permissions of the **File** to have no read, write and execute permissions on **Other**:<br> *(The flag equals to nothing[o=] deny the permissions)*

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
chmod o= File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwx--- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

* Giving **read** and **write** permissions to **Group**:

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
chmod g=rw File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 

* Giving **all permissions** to everybody(Owner,Group and Other):

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
chmod a=rwx File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 


## Using `chmod` - oldschool way:
The chmod command will take the octal value and combine them to associate the permissions on three different positions for the Owner, Group and Other/Everyone. This boils down to a simple binary rule: 0 = off | 1 = on.

Octal | Binary | Permissions
:--:|:--:|:--:
0 | 000 | ---
1 | 001 | --x
2 | 010 | -w-
3 | 011 | -wx
4 | 100 | r--
5 | 101 | r-x
6 | 110 | rw-
7 | 111 | rwx

*If you want to give all permissions to a group for example, the number will be 7 (4 + 2 + 1).*

Read | Write | Execute
:--:|:--:|:--:
r-- | -w- | --x
4 | 2 | 1

#### Examples:

* Giving **read, write and execute** permission to everybody:

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
chmod 777 File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 


* Giving all permissions to the **owner**, read and write to **group** and no permissions to **other/everyone**:

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-r-x---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
chmod 760 File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrw---- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

### Linux - File Ownership using `chown` (change file owner and group)

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user001 user001 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

```console
sudo chown root File
```

```console
ls -l
```

```console
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root user001 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

*The chown command requires sudo*


### `passwd`

Changes the password of current user 
```console
sudo passwd
```

## Network commands

### `ping`
* Can be handful for DNS checks (up / or down) | is a DNS tool to resolves web addresses to an IP address.
* Test reachability - determine round-trip time, and uses ICMP protocol.

```console
~#: ping www.google.com 

PING www.google.com (172.217.168.164): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.217.168.164: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=25.981 ms
64 bytes from 172.217.168.164: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=25.236 ms
--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 25.236/25.608/25.981/0.373 ms
```


### `netstat`
* Network statistics
* Get info on host system TCP / UDP connections and status of all open and listening ports and routing table.

* Who you talking to? 
* Who trying talking to you? 

```console
netstat -a # (show all active connections) (servers)
netstat -n # (hosts)
netstat -b # (Show binaries Windows)
```

### `traceroute`
* Traceroute - how packets get from host to another endpoint. Traceroute is helpful to see what routers are being hit, both internal and external.

* **Take advantage of ICMP Time to Live (TTL) Exceeded error message**
	- The time in TTL refers to hops, not seconds or minutes.
	- TTL=1 is the first router.
	- TTL=2 is the second router, and so on.

</p>

* *As shown above, on HOP 2 the TTL exceeded and back to the device A, counting 3 on TTL for the next HOP.*

```console
~#: traceroute google.com

traceroute to google.com (172.217.17.14), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets

    79.125.252.199 (79.121.251.191)  22.885 ms
```

### `arp` 
* Address resolution protocol - caches of ip-to-ethernet
* Determine a MAC address based on IP addresses
* Option `-a`: view local ARP table
```console
~#: arp -a

? (192.168.1.3) at 00:11:22:33:44:55 [ether] on enp0s10
? (192.168.1.128) at e8:33:b0:70:2c:71 [ether] on enp0s10

_gateway (192.168.1.1) at 00:31:33:8b:2a:da [ether] on enp0s10
```

### `ifconfig`

* Equivalent to ipconfig for UNIX/Linux OS.

```console
~#: ifconfig

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

### `nslookup`

* Query Internet name servers interactively; check if the DNS server is working

```console
nslookup www.certifiedhacker.com

output:
Server:         192.168.1.1
Address:        192.168.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:

Non-authoritative answer:
www.certifiedhacker.com canonical name = certifiedhacker.com.
Name:   certifiedhacker.com
Address: 162.241.216.11

```

### `dig` 
* DNS lookup tool - Functions like nslookup, but allows for further functionality.

```console
dig www.certifiedhacker.com

output:

### `netcat`
TCP/IP swiss army knife; you can make any type of connection and see the results from a command line. With nc you can connect to anything on any port number or you can make your system listen on a port number. Can be an agressive tool for recon.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329745450/figure/fig3/AS:705181092179978@1545139682702/Remote-Command-and-Control-example-through-Netcat.ppm" />
</p>

* "Read" or "Write" to the network
	- Open a port and send or receive some traffic
	- Listen on a port number
	- Transfer data
	- Scan ports and send data to be a port
* Become a backdoor
	- Run a shell from a remote device

### `stat`
