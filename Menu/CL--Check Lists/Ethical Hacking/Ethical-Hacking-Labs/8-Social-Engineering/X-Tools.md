## Wifiphisher
Wifiphisher is a security tool that mounts automated phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks in order to obtain credentials or infect the victims with ‘malware’. It is a social engineering attack that can be used to obtain WPA/WPA2 secret passphrases and unlike other methods, it does not require any brute forcing.
After achieving a man-in-the-middle position using the Evil Twin attack, Wifiphisher redirects all HTTP requests to an attacker-controlled phishing page.
