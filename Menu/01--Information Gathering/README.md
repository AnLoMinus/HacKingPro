> - ## **What are the objectives of information gathering in cybersecurity?**
> - ### Any basic cybersecurity information gathering process often includes these two types of data collection goals:
>   - ### [`Collecting Network Data`](): Such as public, private and associated domain names, network hosts, public and private IP blocks, routing tables, TCP and UDP running services, SSL certificates, open ports and more.
>   - ### [`Collecting System-Related Information`]():  This includes user enumeration, system groups, OS hostnames, OS system type (probably by fingerprinting), system banners (as seen in the banner grabbing blog post), etc.

# Information gathering techniques and methods
- Ethical hackers use a big variety of techniques and tools to get this precious information about their targets, as well as locations and data collection software theyâ€™ll be using towards the information gathering goal.
- Letâ€™s look at the top information gathering methods used to gather information about any target.
> - ## How to gather information?
>    - ### [`Social Engineering`](): This includes in-person chat, phone conversations and email spoofing attacks. 
>        - What all these methods have in common is the psychology of human weakness, needed to get maximum data about the target.
>    - ### [`Search Engines`](): Web crawlers can be used to fetch information about anything, and this includes companies, persons, services, and even real hacks, as seen in our previous article about Google Hacking.
>    - ### [`Social Networks`](): Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks are great sources of information to build a profile, especially when targeting individuals.
>    - ### [`Domain Names`](): These are registered by organizations, governments, public and private agencies, and people. 
>        - Therefore, theyâ€™re a great starting point when you want to investigate someone. 
>        - Personal information, associated domains, projects, services and technologies can be found by inspecting domain name information.
>    - ### [`Internet Servers`](): authoritative DNS servers are a great source of information, as they often include every single surface point exposed to the Internetâ€”which means a direct link to related services such as HTTP, email, etc. In our previous article about passive DNS, we analyzed the importance of DNS servers, and especially passive DNS-recon services, such as the ones we offer here at SecurityTrails.
- All these techniques are really useful when combined with enterprise security tools. Keep reading to discover how to maximize your information gathering results by using some really cool infosec utilities.
