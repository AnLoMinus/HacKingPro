## Security practices to be followed by banks
- Banks can implement some security practices to reduce the range of attack for the attacker. 
- Below we will see some parameters that should be given great attention:

### Protection against physical attacks:
- Detection and protection against skimming of the card.
- Detection and protection against card and cash entrapment.
- Detection against keyboard violation.
- DVSS camera application built into the ATM to record the user's facial features along with transaction details and timestamp.
- Protection of the treasury from fire, explosion, etc.
- Lock protection and again unauthorized access to banknotes or accounts.
- Protection of electricity and grid points.
- Deactivation of unused network as well as electric port.
- The ATM must be grouted on the floor to insure against robbery-related threats. The ATM can be mounted with a vibration sensor to detect the impact and movement of the ATM machine.
- CCTV camera installation. Presence of a guard.

### Protection against hacking attacks:
- Protection against unauthorized booting without using a password and entering the BIOS. Most ATMs have a default boot password.
- USB protection and unauthorized access to the hard disk.
- Secure OS and fully updated on a daily basis.
- Allowed list of applications, services at the ATM.
- Operation with fewer user privileges.
- File integrity checks.
- Securing transaction logs.
- Use secure connection for communication and transaction.
- Formulation of best security practices in the application of ATMs.
- Virus protection.
- Separation of ATM network with other networks.
- Malware protection such as tyupkin, ploutus etc.

### Protection against fraud-based attacks:
- Geo-blocking application. In this application, the card can only be used in the country or region of origin of the card. The user must obtain a license to use the card outside its country of origin.
- Pin-based chip-based card application for mitigating attack based on duplicate cards and skimming cards.
- An application that will detect an unusual transaction in terms of amount, place of transaction, frequency of transaction, etc.
