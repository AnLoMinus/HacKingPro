# Search Exploit 
- ## [getsploit](https://github.com/vulnersCom/getsploit)
  > ### Inspired by searchsploit, it combines two features: command line search and download tool. It allows you to search online for the exploits across all the most popular collections: Exploit-DB, Metasploit, Packetstorm and others. The most powerful feature is immediate exploit source download right in your working path.

- ## [Findsploit](https://github.com/1N3/Findsploit)
  > ### Find exploits in local and online databases instantly
  > #### Finsploit is a simple bash script to quickly and easily search both local and online exploit databases. This repository also includes "copysploit" to copy any exploit-db exploit to the current directory and "compilesploit" to automatically compile and run any C exploit (ie. ./copysploit 1337.c && ./compilesploit 1337.c).
