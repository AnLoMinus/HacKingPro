# Tactical Exploitation Toolkit

:: EasyWin
    
    Easywin is a Python script that provides a toolkit for exploit-less 
    attacks aimed at Windows and Active Directory environments, by leveraging 
    information gathering and brute force capabilities against the SMB protocol.

:: LetMeIn

    Letmein is a pure PowerShell implementation of the staging protocols used by 
    the Metasploit Framework. Start an exploit/multi/handler (Generic Payload Handler) 
    instance on your attack box configured to handle one of the supported Meterpreter 
    payloads, run letmein.ps1 (ideally as Administrator) on a compromised Windows box, 
    and wait for your session. This technique is quite effective in order to bypass 
    the antivirus and obtain a Meterpreter shell on Windows. An alternative Python 
    implementation is also provided for educational purposes, however its use is not 
    recommended in the field.

:: Poriluk

    Poriluk is a helper script that provides a comfortable interface to exploit common 
    information leakage vulnerabilities. At the moment, the following attacks are supported: 
    - dictionary-based user enumeration via SMTP VRFY/EXPN/RCPT and HTTP 
      Apache mod_userdir.

:: BotShot

    Botshot is a Python script that captures screenshots of websites from the command line. 
    It is useful to automate mapping of the web attack surface of large networks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:: Verbal

    Verbal is a HTTP request method security scanner. It tries a series of interesting HTTP 
    methods against a list of website paths, in order to determine which methods are available 
    and accessible. The following HTTP methods are currently supported: GET, OPTIONS, TRACE, DEBUG, PUT.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:: Netdork

    Netdork is a Python script that uses the Google Custom Search Engine API to collect interesting 
    information on public networks and stealthily map the available attack surface. The following 
    attacks are supported: network search sweep based on target CIDRs and subdomain discovery via 
    search engine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:: Seitan

    Seitan is a Python script that uses the Shodan.io API search to collect open source intelligence 
    on targets. The following attacks are currently supported: ipaddr (view all available information 
    for an IP address) and domain (search services related to a domain or host name).
