# The key incantations are:

-o	Enables outputting results to a file. 
	You probably want this if you're not using -s. 
	
	e.g. -o C:\users\thing\snaffler.log


-s	Enables outputting results to stdout as soon as they're found. 
	You probably want this if you're not using -o.


-v	Controls verbosity level, options are:
	- Trace (most verbose), 
	- Debug (less verbose), 
	- Info (less verbose still, default), and 
	- Data (results only). e.g -v debug


-m	Enables and assigns an output dir for snaffler to automatically take a copy of 
	(or Snaffle... if you will) any found files that it likes.


-l	Maximum size of files (in bytes) to Snaffle. 
	Defaults to 10000000, which is about 10MB.


-i	Disables computer and share discovery, 
	! requires a path to a directory in which to perform file discovery.


-d	Domain to search for computers to search for shares on to search for files in. 
	Easy.


-c	Domain controller to query for the list of domain computers.


-r	The maximum size file (in bytes) to search inside for interesting strings. 
	Defaults to 500k.


-j	How many bytes of context either side of found strings in files to show, 
	e.g. -j 200


-z Path to a config file that defines all of the above, and much much more! 
	See below for more details. 
	
	Give it -z generate to generate a sample config file called .\default.toml.
