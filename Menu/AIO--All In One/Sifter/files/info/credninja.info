CredNinja
***********

This tool is intended for penetration testers who want to perform an engagement 
quickly and efficiently. While this tool can be used for more covert operations 
(including some additions below), it really shines when used at the scale of a 
large network.

At the core of it, you provide it a list of credentials you have dumped (or hashes, 
it can pass-the-hash) and a list of systems on the domain (I suggest scanning for 
port 445 first, or you can use "--scan"). It will tell you if the credentials you 
dumped are valid on the domain, and if you have local administrator access to a host. 
See below for additional features, like user hunting and host detail enumeration.

Changelog:

   v2.3 - Updated with some additional features
        
	* Added gnmap file parsing.  The file provided to the --systems (-s) argument
	  can now be a gnmap file (ending in .gnmap)
	* Added cidr notation parsing. The IP address provided to the --systems (-s)
	  argument can now be in cidr notation and it will properly expand the range
	  and test all systems within the ip space (make sure you provide --scan to 
	  scan the systems ahead of time!)
	* Made --scan multithreaded so it runs MUCH faster

   v2.0 - Initial release of CredNinja from the predecessor CredSwissArmy:

	* Same ability as the previous CredSwissArmy (using credentials and host list
	  to search for Local Admin access across a network via SMB)
        * Fully multithreaded!  It is 8x the speed of the old CredSwissArmy!
        * Handles errors and complex passwords much better
        * Can still pass-the-hash with the "--ntlm" option
        * Still has the same arguments as before
        * Added "--timeout", which allows scans to get done faster if you wish
        * Added "--scan", which runs a quick port 445 scan of the hosts to make sure 
	  they are connectable before trying creds on them
        * Added "--stripe", which tests each credential once across a random system 
	  (used to validate credentials without appearing suspicious in one systems' 
	  event log)
        * Added "--delay", which allows you to specify a delay between scanning hosts 
	  to be more covert.  "--delay 10 20" will delay for 10 seconds with a 20% 
	  jitter (so between 8-10 seconds)
        * Added color output so its more obvious when you get success!

	AND NOW THE COOL ADDITIONS

        * Added "--os", which shows the operating system of each system that it can 
	  fingerprint (no additional packet is sent to target host)
        * Added "--domain", which shows the primary domain the system is a member of 
	  (no additional packet is sent to the target host)
        * Added "--users", which shows a list of users' whose home directories have 
	  been modified in X amount of days (X is modifiable by "--users-days", default 
	  of 100). Basically an SMB User-Hunter that shows where users are logged in to 
	  or have been logged in to  (1 additional packet is sent to each target host)
        * Coming soon: Anti-virus detector to give notice to potential antivirus running 
	  on the system
