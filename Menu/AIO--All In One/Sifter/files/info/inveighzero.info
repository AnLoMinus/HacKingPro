InveighZero
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

InveighZero is a C# LLMNR/NBNS/mDNS/DNS/DHCPv6 spoofer and man-in-the-middle tool designed 
to assist penetration testers/red teamers that find themselves limited to a Windows system. 
This version shares many features with the PowerShell version of Inveigh.


# Privileged Mode Features (elevated admin required)

	SMB capture - packet sniffer based
	LLMNR spoofer - packet sniffer based
	NBNS spoofer - packet sniffer based
	mDNS spoofer - packet sniffer based
	DNS spoofer - packet sniffer based
	DHCPv6 spoofer - packet sniffer based
	Pcap output - TCP and UDP packets
	Packet sniffer console output - SYN packets, SMB kerberos negotiation, etc
	Unprivileged Mode Features
	LLMNR spoofer - UDP listener based
	NBNS spoofer - UDP listener based
	mDNS spoofer - UDP listener based
	DNS spoofer - UDP listener based
	DHCPv6 spoofer - UDP listener based

@Note: The NBNS spoofer should work on all systems even with NBNS enabled. 
 The LLMNR and mDNS spoofers seem to work on Windows 10 and Server 2016 with 
 those services already enabled. Firewalls can still get in the way of everything.

	Proxy auth capture - TCP listener based
	Notable Missing Features

@Capture and log data can be imported from previous output files. 
 The PowerShell version stores data in a global variable that persists 
 within the PowerShell instance.

##InveighZero does not execute in the background. 
##Instead, a console is accessible while InveighZero is running. 
##The console has commands that have similar functionality to Inveigh's 
	- Get-Inveigh, 
	- Watch-Inveigh, and 
	- Stop-Inveigh support functions.

# Why The Zero In The Name?

	Inveigh started as a C# proof of concept before I switched over to PowerShell. 
	The "Zero" is just a reference to the fact that the C# version sort of existed 
	before the PowerShell version. Mainly though, I just needed a unique repo name.
