AttackSurfaceMapper
*********************

Attack Surface Mapper is a reconnaissance tool that uses a mixture of open source intellgence and active techniques to expand the attack surface of your target. You feed in a mixture of one or more domains, subdomains and IP addresses and it uses numerous techniques to find more targets. It enumerates subdomains with bruteforcing and passive lookups, Other IPs of the same network block owner, IPs that have multiple domain names pointing to them and so on.

Once the target list is fully expanded it performs passive reconnaissance on them, taking screenshots of websites, generating visual maps, looking up credentials in public breaches, passive port scanning with Shodan and scraping employees from LinkedIn.
