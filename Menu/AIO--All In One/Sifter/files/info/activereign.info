ActiveReign
************

Background
	A while back I was challenged to write a discovery tool with Python3 that could automate the process of finding sensitive information on network file shares. After writing the entire tool with pysmb, and adding features such as the ability to open and scan docx an xlsx files, I slowly started adding functionality from the awesome Impacket library; just simple features I wanted to see in an internal penetration testing tool. The more I added, the more it looked like a Python3 rewrite of CrackMapExec created from scratch.

	If you are doing a direct comparison, CME is an amazing tool that has way more features than currently implement here. However, I added a few new features and modifications that may come in handy during an assessment.

Operational Modes
	db - Query or insert values in to the ActiveReign database
	enum - System enumeration & module execution
	shell - Spawn a simulated shell on the target system and perform command execution
	spray - Domain password spraying and brute force
	query - Perform LDAP queries on the domain

Key Features
	Automatically extract domain information via LDAP and incorporate into network enumeration.
	Perform Domain password spraying using LDAP to remove users close to lockout thresholds.
	Local and remote command execution, for use on multiple starting points throughout the network.
	Simulated interactive shell on target system, with file upload and download capabilities.
	Data discovery capable of scanning xlsx and docx files.
	Various modules to add and extend capabilities.
	Acknowledgments
	There were many intended and unintended contributors that made this project possible. If I am missing any, I apologize, it was in no way intentional. Feel free to contact me and we can make sure they get the credit they deserve ASAP!

Final Thoughts
	Writing this tool and testing on a variety of networks/systems has taught me that execution method matters, and depends on the configuration of the system. If a specific module or feature does not work, determine if it is actually the program, target system, configuration, or even network placement before creating an issue.

	To help this investigation process, I have created a test_execution module to run against a system with known admin privileges. This will cycle through all all execution methods and provide a status report to determine the best method to use:
