!Termux

    MkCheck works well in Termux, provided you are able to run root. 
    Otherwise Nethunter (with chroot) works as well, without any extra config.
    For Termux you should download the release from https://github.com/s1l3nt78/MkCheck/releases/download/v3_0/Release_v3.zip

    Then run:
        
        # unzip Release_v3.zip
        # cd Release_v3
        # bash setup.sh

! Functions

! MkCheck matches IP address to WiFi Access Point Names

! If routersploit module confirms if the Mikrotik device is vulnerable and if found - displays login credentials
  Which must be entered into scripts/miko.py for MkCheck's auto search module to correctly work.

! ByTheWay Root Shell Check The exploit leverages the path traversal vulnerability CVE-2018-14847 to extract the admin password and create an "option" package
  to enable the developer backdoor. Post exploitation the attacker can connect to Telnet or SSH using the root user "devel" with the admin's password.

    
    Change These:
    ****************
    username = "admin"
    password = "admin"

! The main function auto spawns ssh sessions on the compromised targets to enumerate the Network Access Point name from IP
! This is done through command = "/system identity print"
! The logs are then automatically cleaned via "/console clear-history" command.

! You can change the command value in order to enumerate different data.
! Chaning the command to "/system default-configuration print" will print out the default configuration
! Once the Network AP Name has been found the attacker can use the IP and login credentials to work with Mikrotik Routers config from a web-session.

! Results are automatically saved in organised in their respective folders

! Version: 3 [Mthread Still in Development]

! The mthread script is still in development and still needs some optimization and will get 
  rid of redundancies. As well as clean up alot of the unnecessary code.
  mthread does NOT work in Termux
  mthread script added to speed up scans.


! Automatic Clean-Up of SSH command history done in order to remain hidden.

    mkcheck will work correctly in termux, but
    mthread will not as it relies on external xterm windows. 

! USAGE

    The user must create the 'scripts/tiks.txt' list with MikroTik Router IP's.
    Easiest way to do this is using Shodan for Vuln searching. WinBox Auth Bypass looks for port 8291
    nMap can be used as well, using the following command:

# sudo nmap -vv -O -A -Pn -p 80,8291 111.11.11.1/24 This will scan the given IP block for all online devices and check if the appropriate services are running and vulnerable

! Once the attacker has a specific netblock (eg. 111.69.145.1/24), the best way to create the list is using Microsoft Excel 
! As you need to fill in the first block (111.69.145.0), then you can drag the coloum to quickly fill the IP's in the colom. 
! Then copy the entire block into the 'scripts/tiks.txt' file.
